     1/2           cup  fresh parsley -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh tarragon -- minced
                        fresh lemon juice

In a small bowl stir together the mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of the parsley, the tarragon, the lemon juice, the tabasco and salt and pepper to taste. Spread one side of the bread slices with the mayo, arrange the onion slices evenly on half the bread slices, and top them with the remaining bread slices. Press sandwiches together gently, trim the crusts, and cut the sandwiches into quarters. Put the remaining parsley in a shallow bowl and dip the edges of the sandwich quarters in the parsley.
