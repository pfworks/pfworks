     1/4           cup  black pepper
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  1 1/2      teaspoons  light brown sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  2                     1.25 lb bone-in rib-eye steaks
                        kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

In a bowl, whisk together everything except the steaks, salt, and oil. Rub 1 tablespoon spice mix on each side of the steaks and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.

Season steaks with salt. In a large cast-iron skillet, heat oil until shimmering. Add steaks and cook over moderate heat, turning once, until medium rare, 6-7 minutes per side. Transfer to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Cut steak off bone, slice across the grain and serve.
