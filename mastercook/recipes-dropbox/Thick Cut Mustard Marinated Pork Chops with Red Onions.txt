Heat a large 2 burner griddle pan over medium heat for 5 minutes until smoking hot. Cook pork until nicely browned on both sides, about 5 to 6 minutes on each side. While the chops are finishing, heat the vegetable oil over med-high heat in a large skillet. Add onions and cook for about 4 minutes. Then drizzle onions with honey and balsamic and cook until softened and lightly carmelized, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
