--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  pork belly -- with or without rib bones
  4          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly ground black pepper
  6                     poblano pepper -- stemmed and coarsely chopped
  3                     habanero chile -- stemmed, sliced into 1/4" rounds
  3                     serrano pepper -- stemmed and chopped
  1                cup  agave syrup
                        vegetable oil
  1                     ripe pineapple (about 3.5 pounds) -- 1/2" rounds
     1/4           cup  apple cider vinegar

Preheat oven to 250. Season pork belly all over with 4 tspns salt and 2 teaspoons pepper.

Place chiles in a large roasting pan. Place pork belly, skin side down, on top of chiles; drizzle with 1/2 cup agave. Pour remaining 1/2 cup agave and 2 cups water into pan. Cover pan tightly with lid or two layers of foil.

Transfer to oven and cook pork for 3 hours, basting with pan juices every hour. Turn pork over. Cook until very tender, about 4 more hours.

Transfer pork to another roasting pan (if bone-in, remove and discard bones) Strain liquid from first pan into a saucepan; reserve chiles. Gently boil juices until reduced to about 1.25 cups (45-50 minutes); add reserved chiles. Remove pan from heat. Let glaze cool; chill.

Meanwhile, cover pork with parchment or waxed paper. Top with a large plate. Place weights on top. Chill overnight.

Reheat glaze. Build a medium hot fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to high. Brush grill with oil. Grill pineapple until nicely charred, 2-3 minutes per side; place on plates. 

Let grill cool to medium. Slice pork belly into 1" thick pieces. Grill until warmed and crisp, about 3 minutes per side. Brush pork with some of the glaze.

To serve, place 2 or 3 pineapple slices on each plate; spoon glaze over, then top with pork belly. Drizzle with vinegar.
