  1              pinch  mustard seed

For the sauce: (for the horde!)  In a medium saute pan over medium heat, add oil and onions. Cook until brown and carmelized. Add the tomatoes  and garlic and cook for a few minutes. Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 30 minutes. Optionally blend.

Preheat oven to 250.

In a medium pan over medium to high heat, add bacon and onions, cook until the bacon is rendered but not crisp. Add the chorizo and cook until done. Remove the bacon mixture to a paper towel-lined platee to drain and cool.

Divide ground chuck into 8 equal parts. Form into a loose ball, and create 4 inch patties. Layer 1 piece of cheese onto the center of 1 patty. Top with 1/4 bacon mixture, another slice of cheese, then add another patty on top and gentely seal edges to form a super patty about 4 inches wide and 1.5 inches hight. Repeat to make 4.

Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat. Place all 4 patties in the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on 1 side, then gently turn over and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Remove pan from heat, cover and pop into a 250 degree oven for 10 minutes.

Remove from oven, place patties on rolls and serve with the worcestershire tomato ketchup.
