  1              small  onion -- quartered
  4              large  tomatoes
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             pounds  chicken pieces
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  1               each  chipotle chile canned in adobo (1 chile) -- finely chopped

Heat a large cast-iron or heavy skillet, without oil, on high heat. When pan is very hot (3-4 minutes) put in garlic, onions and tomatoes. Stirring every few minutes, cook the onion and garlic till they brown out on all sides and become fragrant, about 10 minutes. (garlic may be removed earlier) Move tomatoes around with tongs until they blacken and most of the skin is blistered. Remove and reserve vegetables.

In another skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and put it skin side down in skillet. Brown the chicken well for aboujt 15 minutes. Turn chicken over and cook on bone side for 5 minutes. Remove and reserve the chicken. Drain fat from pan.

Skin and core the tomatoes and cut in half crosswise; gently squeeze out the seeds. Put the garlic, onion, tomatoes and chipotle in a blender and puree into a smooth sauce. Pour sauce back into a large skillet and add the chicken pieces back to the pan. Simmer the chicken gently in the sauce, covered, until cooked through, 20-30 minutes. Transfer chicken to wide soup plates. Season sauce with salt and spoon over chicken. Sprinkle cilantro, jalapeno, sour cream and lime on chicken.
