--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        bbq sauce
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced

     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  worcestershire sauce
  2        tablespoons  spicy brown mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  hot red pepper sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  liquid smoke flavoring
                        meatballs
  1              pound  ground pork
     1/3           cup  dried plain bread crumbs
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  yellow onion -- minced
  2        tablespoons  bbq sauce
  2             cloves  garlic -- crushed thru press
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper

To make the bbq sauce, heat the butter in a heavy bottomed, medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chili sauce, molasses, vinegar, worcestshire sauce, and mustard and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring often, until the sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in hot sauce and liquid smoke. Let cool completely.

Combine pork, bread crumbs, egg, onion, bbq sauce, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for 15 minutes to 4 hours.

Shape meat into 12 meatballs.

Place meatballs in basket and close it. Grill 3 minutes per side. Brush with bbq sauce and grill for 2 more minutes.

Serve hot with sauce on the side.
