  1              large  yellow bell pepper -- roasted, peeled and seeded
  1              large  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled and seeded
  3                     Anaheim chiles
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                     jalepeno -- cored, seeded and minced
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2         small  red onion -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  chile powder
  2        tablespoons  cilantro
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast -- 6-8 ounces each
     2/3           cup  sour cream

Divide red and yellow peppers, setting aside half of each for later use. Dice remaining peppers and anaheim chiles. In saute pan, add canola oil, and saute jalapeno, garlic and onion for 4-5 minutes. Add diced bell peppers, chiles, chile powder, salt, pepper and cilantro and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.

Pound chicken breasts until fairly thin.  Cover half of breast with stuffing and fold over other half. Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.

In blender or food processor, blend remaining red bell pepper and 1/3 cup sour cream until smooth. Remove from container and set aside. Repeat with yellow bell pepper and sour cream.

Slice each chicken breast crosswise into 1/2 inch medallions. Arrange on plate and pour sauces in criss cross pattern over top.
