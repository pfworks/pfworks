--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        cake
  3               cups  sifted cake flour -- (not self-rising)
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2 1/4         sticks  unsalted butter (1 cup plus 2 tbspns)
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- warmed in warm water 5 minutes
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  well-stirred plain, whole-milk (not greek) yogurt at room temp
                        frosting
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  boiling hot water
  1         tablespoon  light corn syrup
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate (60%)
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate (100%)
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  3             sticks  unsalted butter (1.5 cups) -- cut into tablespoons and softened

Make cake layers: Heat oven to 350 with racks in upper and lower third. Butter 3 8 or 9 inch cake pans, then line bottoms with rounds of parchment and butter the paper. Dust pans with flour.

Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a bowl.

Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture alternatively with yogurt in 3 batches, beginning and ending with flour mixture and mixing just until smooth. Divide batter between pans (about 2.75 cups per pan), spreading evenly, then rap each pan on counter once or twice to eliminate air bubbles.

Bake layers, switching position of pans and rearranging them in oven halfway through baking time, until cake begins to pull away from the side of pan and toothpick comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes total for 9 inch, and 20 to 25 for 8 inch.

Cool 10 minutes in pans on racks, then run a knife around edge and invert layers onto racks to cool completely.

Frosting: Whick together sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a heavy saucepan, then whisk in boiling hot water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking, then reduce heat and simmer, whisking constantly, 1 minute.

Remove pan from heat and whisk in corn syrup. Add chocolates and vanilla, then stir once. Let stand 1 minutes, and stir again until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth.

Transfer mixture to a metal bowl and set bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir until it has cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes.

WIth and electric mixer, beat in butter, 2 tablespoons at a time, until incorporated and frosting is light and holds soft peaks.

Put a layer, bottom side up, on a cake plate or stand. Spread 1 cup of frosting over top. Cover with another layer, bottom side up, and spread with another cup of frosting. Top with third layer, bottom side up.

Spread a thin layer of frosting around sides and over top of cake with spatula offset. Chill or briefly freeze cake until frosting is just firm.

Spread sides and top of cake with remaining frosting.
