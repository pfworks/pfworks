  1         tablespoon  sweet paprika
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
                        salt and pepper
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne powder
  5             pounds  flat-cut beef brisket -- trimmed
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  3                     onion -- halved and sliced 1/2" thick
  1         tablespoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  3                     fresh thyme sprigs
  3                     bay leaves

Combine paprika, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and cayenne in bowl. Using fork, prick brisket al over. Rub spice mixture over brisket, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8 to 24 hours. Unwrap brisket and place in slow cooker.

Heat oil in 12 inch skillet over med-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, sugar, tomato paste, and garlic and cook until onions are softened and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in broth, scraping up any browned bits and smoothing out any lumps; transfer to slow cooker.

Stir 2 tablespoons vinegar, thyme sprigs, and bay leaves into slow cooker. Cover and cook until beef is tender, 9 to 11 hours on low or 5 to 7 hours on high.

Transfer brisket to cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Let braising liquid settle for 5 minutes, then remove fat from surface. Discard thyme and bay leaves. Stir in remaining teaspoon vinegar and season with salt and pepper.

Slice brisket 1/2" thick against grain and arrange on platter. Spoon 1 cup sauce over meat and serve with remaining sauce.
