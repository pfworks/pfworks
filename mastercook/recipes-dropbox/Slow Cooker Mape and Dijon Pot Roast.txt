Pour off all but 2 tbspns of the bacon fat. Reduce heat to medium. Add the onions and cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Pour in a few tablespoons of stock and bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits. Pour onions and juices into slow cooker.

In a separate bowl, whick the remaining chicken stock, Dijon, balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, paprika, salt and pepper until combines. Pour over roast. Close lid and cook on low until meat falls apart, about 8 hours.

Transfer roast to a serving bowl or platter and cover with foil. Pour liquids into a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced. Cut roast into chunks and pour hot gravy over top.
