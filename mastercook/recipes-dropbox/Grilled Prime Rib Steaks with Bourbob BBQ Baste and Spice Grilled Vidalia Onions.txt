Heat the butter and oil over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add the onions and garlic and cook until trnaslucent, 3 to 4 minutes.

Add the remaining ingredients, excluding salt, pepper and steaks, and simmer for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour into bowl and cool slightly. Whisk in remaining 2 tbspns of bourbon.

Heat grill to high. Season steaks on both sides liberally with salt and pepper and rub some of the onion spice rub into 1 side. Place steaks on grill, spice rub side down, and grill until slightly charred and crusty, about 4-5 minutes. Brush steaks with some of the Bourbon BBQ baste and turn over; reduce heat to med-low and cook to med rare, about 8-9 minutes longer. Brush with sauce every 2 minutes. Remove from grill, brush with sauce, and let rest 5 minutes before slicing into 1/4" thick slices.

Onions: Heat grill to high. Whisk together spices in a small bowl. Brush onions with oil on both sides. Rub 1 side of each onion with some spice mixture and place rub side down on grill. Grill until golden brown and a crust has formed. Turn the onions over and continue grilling until just cooked through. Serve with steaks.
