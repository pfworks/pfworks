Cook over med heat, whisking constantly, until pudding thickens and boils, about 5 minutes. Add butter and stir until melted. Spread warm pudding in cooled crust. Chill until filling is cool, about 1 hour.

Thinly slice 3 bananas on diagonal. Combine slices and 2 tbspns orange juice in medium bowl; toss to coat. Transfer slices to paper towels and pat dry. Arrange in single layer over pudding to cover completely.

Fold large spoonfuls of cream into pb mixture to looses, then fold in remaining cream in 2 additions. SPread evenly over bananas. Chill at least three hours.
