                        rub
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground tumeric
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        ribs
  2 1/2         pounds  short ribs
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3 1/2           cups  low sodium beef stock
  3                     carrot -- 2" chunks
  10                    baby red or yukon gold potatoes
     1/2                onion -- cut in half, root intact
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  dried apricot
  2          teaspoons  lemon juice

Combine rub ingredients and rub into ribs, coating all sides.

Sear the ribs in olive oil over high heat, until all sides are browned, about 7-10 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a slow cooker, pouring off any excess oil from the pan. Deglaze the pan with 3 cups beef stock, scraping brown bits. Pour over ribs.

Add carrots, potatoes, honey, red pepper flakes and onion to the slow cooker. Simmer the ribs on high heat until they are fork tender, about 3.5 hours.

Discard onion and strain fat from surface.

Whisk flour and 1/2 cup beef stock together and slowly stir in slow cooker. Add dried apricots and simmer for another 1/2 hour, until thickened. Stir in lemon juice before serving.
