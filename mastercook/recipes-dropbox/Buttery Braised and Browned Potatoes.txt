--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small red potatoes -- halved
  2               cups  water
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             cloves  garlic -- peeled
  3             sprigs  fresh thyme
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  fresh lemon juice
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
  2        tablespoons  fresh chives -- minced

Arrange potatoes in single layer, cut side down, in 12-inch nonstick skillet. Add water, butter, garlic, thyme, and salt and bring to a simmer over med-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.

Remove lid and use slotted spoon to transfer garlic to cutting board. Increase heat to med-high and vigourously simmer, swirling pan occasionally, until water evaporates and butter starts to sizzle, 7 to 10 minutes. When cool enough to handle, mince garlic to paste. Transfer paste to bown and stir in lemon juice and pepper.

Continue to cook potatoes, swirling pan frequently, until butter browns and potatoes are golden, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Off heat, add garlic mixture and chives and toss to coat. Serve.
