--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2             pounds  ground beef
  4             cloves  garlic -- chopped
     1/2           cup  ketchup
  1                cup  smoky, tomato based BBQ sauce
  1         tablespoon  hot red pepper sauce
  2        tablespoons  mustard

In a deep, 10 inch frying pan, heat olive oil and saute onion over medium heat just until it starts to soften. Crumble beef into pan and stir with a slotted spoon to break it up as much as possible. Cook beef and onions over low heat, continuing to stir, just until beef is lightly browned. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute longer. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Cook, uncovered, over low heat for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick.
