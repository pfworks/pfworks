--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        dough
  1                cup  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              large  egg
  2 1/4      teaspoons  rapid-rise yeast
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        nonstick vege spray
                        filling
     3/4           cup  golden brown sugar -- packed
  2        tablespoons  ground cinnamon
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- room temp
                        glaze
  4             ounces  cream cheese -- room temp
  1                cup  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- room temp
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

For dough: Combine milk and butter in glass measuring cup. Microwave on high until butter melts and mixture is just warmed to 120 to 130, 30-45 seconds. Pour into mixer with paddle. Add 1 cup flour, sugar, egg, yeast and salt. Beat on low speed 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides. Add 2.5 cups flour. Beat on low until flour is absorbed and dough is sticky, scrpaing down sides. Turn dough out onto lightly flowered surface. Knead for about 8 minutes. Form into ball.

Lightly oil large bowl with nonstick spray. Transfer dough to bowl, turning to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise for about 2 hours.

Mix brown sugar and cinnamon in medium bowl. Punch down dough.

Transfer to floured work surface. Roll out to 15x11 rectangle. Spread butter over dough, leaving a 1/2" border. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar evenly over butter. Starting at one long side, roll dough into log, pinching gently to keep it rolled up. With seam side down, cut dough crosswise with thin sharp knife into 18 slices, each about 1/2" to 3/4" wide.

Spray 2 nine inch square glass baking dishes with spray. Divide rolls between dishes, arranging cut side up. Cover with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise until almost doubled, 40-45 minutes.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375. Bake rolls until tops are golden, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and invert immediately onto rak. Cool 10 minutes. Turn right side up.

Glaze: Combine cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla in medium bowl. Beat until smooth. Spread on rolls.
