  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  8             ounces  elbow macaroni
                        butter
  7             ounces  extra sharp cheddar -- 1/2" cubes
  6             ounces  extra sharp cheddar -- grated
  2        tablespoons  flour
  1           teaspoon  flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dry mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg -- grated
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
     2/3           cup  sour cream
  2                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2           cups  half and half
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/3           cup  onion -- grated
  1           teaspoon  worcestershire sauce

Heat oven to 350. Bring a 4 qt saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until cooked halfway through, about 3 minutes. Drain pasta and transfer to a greased 9x13 baking dish. Stir in the cubed cheddar and set aside.

Combine 1.5 tsp salt, flour, mustard, black pepper, nutmeg and cayenne in a large mixing bowl. Add the sour cream and the eggs and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the half and half, heavy cream, onions, and worcestershire. Pour egg mixture over the pasta and stir to combine. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the surface. Bake until set around edges but still a bit loose in center, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
