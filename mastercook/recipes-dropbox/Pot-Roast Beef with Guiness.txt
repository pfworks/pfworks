  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  rolled brisket of beef
  10            ounces  onions -- roughly chopped
  2                     celery stalk -- thickly sliced
  1              pound  carrots -- cut into large chunks
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  beef stock
  1 1/4           cups  Guiness
  1                     bay leaf
  3        tablespoons  fresh thyme -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
  1         tablespoon  tomato puree
                        salt and pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  potato -- peeled and cut into large chunks.

Preheat oven to 350. Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole and brown meat all over.

Remove the meat from the pan and drain it on a double layer of paper towels. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 4 minutes.

Add the celery, carrot and potato to the casserole and cook over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes.

Stir in the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Pour in beef stock and Guiness and stir until well combined. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring constantly with wooden spoon.

Add the bay leaf, thyme, sugar, mustard, puree and plenty of seasoning. Place the meat on top, cover tightly and transfer to oven.

Cook for about 2.5 hours, or until veges and meat are tender. Adjust the seasoning and add another pinch of sugar, if neccessary. Serve with the gravy.
