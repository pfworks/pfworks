--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  white rice
  6             slices  bacon -- chopped
  1               head  broccoli -- cut into pieces
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  sesame oil
  4              large  eggs
                        kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
  2                     scallion -- diced
  2        tablespoons  pickled jalapeno -- chopped

Place the rice in a medium saucepan with 2.5 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook 12 more minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until ready to serve.

Cook bacon in a large, nonstick skiller over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer to paper towel lined plate. Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of bacon grease and increase heat to medium high. Add broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, until charred in spots. Add 3/4 cup water and simmer until broccoli is crisp-tender and only a few tablespoons of water remain, about 5 minutes. Stir in soy sauce and 1/2 tspn sesame oil. Divide rice and broccoli evenly among bowls and drizzle withpan juices.

Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil in the skiller over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into skillet, season with salt and fry. Place an egg in each owl and top with bcon, cilantro, scallions and jalepenos.
