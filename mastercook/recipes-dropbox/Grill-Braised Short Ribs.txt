--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  24            ounces  wheat beer
  1 1/2           cups  water
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  5             pounds  beef short ribs (6-8 English style ribs) -- trimmed
                        salt and pepper
  3                     onion -- peeled and cut into 1/2" rounds
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Heat all burners on high, covered for 15 minutes or light about 100 coals. When covered in fine grey ash, spread out. Open lid vent halfway and cover for 5 minutes.

Combine beer, water, brown sugar, and thyme in a large disposable aluminum pan; set aside. Pat ribs dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Brush onion rounds with oil and season with salt and pepper. Gril until ribs are well browned and onions lightly charred, 5-7 minutes per side.

Transfer ribs, bone side up, and onions to pan with beer mixture, cover with foil, and place pan on grill. Turn to low and cook, covered, until ribs are nearly tender, about 1.5 hours.

Light 50 more coals and spreadt out when ready over old coals. Remove foil and continue to cook until ribs are tender and sauce thickened, about 1.5 hours more. Transfer ribs and onions to platter and tent with foil. Strain sauce into fat seperator. Let settle and pour off fat. Serve with ribs.
