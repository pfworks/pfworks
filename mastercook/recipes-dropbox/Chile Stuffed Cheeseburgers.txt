  2                     jalapeno
  2                     anaheim chili pepper
                        extra virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- unpeeled
  4             ounces  monterey jack cheese -- shredded
                        salt and pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
  4                     kaiser rolls
                        lettuce, onions, tomatoes, etc

Light grill and rub chiles with olive oil. Thread the jalapenos and garlic onto a skewer and grill until charred all over. Using tongs, repeat with anaheims. Peel chiles and discard stems and seeds. Peel garlic. Chop chiles and garlic and transfer to a bowl. Fold in the cheese and season with salt and pepper. 

Cut 8 6" squares of wax paper; divide beef among them. Pat each into a 5" round, a little thicker in the center. Using a 1/4 cup measure, mound 1/4 of the cheese mixture in the centers of 4 patties. Top with remaining patties; press edges to seal. Flatten the centers so that the burgers are even. Brush with oil and season with salt and pepper. Brush cut sides of rolls with oil.

Lightly oil grate. Grill burgers about 7 minutes, turning once. Toast kaiser rolls. Top with produce and serve with condiments.
