--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  prewashed quinoa
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into 2 pieces
  1              small  onion -- minced
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  water
  3        tablespoons  fresh herbs -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Toast quinoa in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, tossing frequently, until very fragrant and makes continuous popping sound, 5-7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Return empty saucepan to medium low heat and melt butter. Add onion and salt; cook, stirring frequently, until onion is softened and light golden, 5 to 7 minutes.

Increase heat to medium high, stir in water and quinoa and bring to simmer. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until grains are just tender and liquid is absorbed, 18-20 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking. Remove pot from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff with fork, stir in herbs and lemon juice, and serve.
