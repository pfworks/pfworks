--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  beef brisket
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  onion -- chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  2               cups  New Mexico green chiles -- roasted, peeled, seeded and chopped
  3          teaspoons  mexican oregano
  2               cups  tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
  2               cups  beef broth
                        salt to taste

Preheat oven to 325

Brown beef in oil and remove from pan. Add the onion and garlic to the oil and saute until soft.

Place all ingredients in a roasting pan. Cover and bake for 3 hours, or until meat is tender and falls apart. Turn meat occasionally, adding broth if it seems dry.

Remove meat, allow to cool enough to handle, and then shred with fingers, discarding fat and connective tissue. Place roasting pan on cooktop and simmer until remaining liquid is reduced to about 2 cups. Mix shredded meat with sauce.
