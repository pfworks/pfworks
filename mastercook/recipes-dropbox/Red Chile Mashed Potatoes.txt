--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1               head  garlic
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  white wine
  4                     Yukon Gold Potatoes
  1         tablespoon  butter
     3/4           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  red chile powder
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        black pepper

Place the garlic on a square of foil and drizzle with olive oil and wine. Wrap the garlic tightly and roast in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes, or until soft. Using the tip of a sharp knife, life out each clove.

Peel the potatoes and place in a pot of boiling, salted water. Cook 30 minutes, or until very tender but not falling apart. Drain.

Put the potatoes in a blender fitted with a whisk attachment. Break up the potatoes with a fork. With the mixer going, slowly add the butter, milk, sour cream, red chile and garlic. Add salt and pepper and continue beating for a couple of minutes. Garnish with a dusting of chile powder and chopped cilantro. Serve immediately.
