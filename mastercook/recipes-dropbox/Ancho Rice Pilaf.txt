--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             medium  onion -- chopped fine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- roasted, seeded and chopped
  1                     fresh red jalepeno pepper -- seeded and minced
  1                cup  long grain rice
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile puree
  1 1/2           cups  chicken broth -- heated
                        salt and freshly ground black pepper
  1              large  scallion -- sliced

In a large, deep skillet with a cover, saute the onions in oil over medium-low heat until they are soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the minced garlic into the onions and cook 1 minute more. Add the chopped red pepper, minced chile, and rice, and cook over medium heat, stirring, until all the rice is coated with oil and has turned translucent, 3 to 4 minutes (do not burn rice!). Stir in the chile puree, the heated broth, and salt and pepper to taste, and cover with a tight lid. Turn the heat to low, and cook the rice about 20 mintues, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through. When ready to serve, fluff with a fork and stir in scallions.
