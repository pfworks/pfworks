  4                     sirloin steaks, 8 oz each
                        Marinade
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  4        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Bloody Mary Sauce
  2 1/4         pounds  very ripe tomatoes -- peeled and chopped
                        tomato paste -- if tomatoes aren't ripe
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  2                     scallion
  1           teaspoon  cilantro -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  cumin -- ground
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
     1/2           cup  beef consomme
     1/4           cup  vodka
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce

Lay the steaks in a shallow dish. Mix the marinade ingredients together, pour over steaks and let marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, turning once or twice.

Place all the sauce ingredients in a food processor and blend to a fairly smooth texture. Add a little paste if the tomatoes aren't ripe. Put in a saucepan, bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes.

Remove steaks from dish and discard marinade. Cook for 3-6 minutes per side. Serve with sauce.
