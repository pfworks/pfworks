Add turmeric, vinegar, and garlic and mix. Pour the marinade over the pork and rub well. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over med-high heat until hot. Add the cinnamon, cloves, onions and ginger. Cook until the onions are very soft, about 5 minutes. Remove pork from the refrigerator and drain, reserving liquid. Add pork to the onion mixture and cook until the meat is lightly seared. Add paprika, syrup, water, salt and reserved liquid and bring to a boil. Simmper pork for 1.5 hours or until very tender. Server plain or with rice.
