--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  4             ounces  pepperoni -- 1/4" squares
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  6             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4           cup  fresh parsley -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh chives -- minced
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
                        flour
  1              pound  pizza dough
     1/4           cup  pecorino romano cheese
                        pizza sauce

Heat butter and oil in a 10" cast iron skillet over medium heat until butter melts and foaming subsides. Add pepperoni and cook, stirring, until pepperoni begins to crisp, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add parsley and chives and stir to combine. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in parmesan. Do not wipe skillet.

On a lightly floured surface, divide dough into two even pieces. Working one piece at a time, roll or stretch into an oblong about 8x4. Cut crosswise into 12 strips. Repeat with other half.

Tie each strip into a knot and transfer to bowl with pepperoni/garlic mixture. Toss and fold with your hands until every knot is coated. Transfer knots to skillet in single layer. Drizzle with more olive oil, cover tightly with plastic, and set aside until doubled in size, about 4 hours. Or refrigerate for 12-16 hours.

Preheat oven to 425 and put rack in center. Unwrap garlic knots. Sprinkle with Romano cheese. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, 25-30 minutes.

Remove from oven and brush with olive oil and sprinkle with Parmesan. Serve with warmed sauce.
