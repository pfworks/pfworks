  3             pounds  poblano pepper (about 12)
  7 1/2         pounds  pork butt country style strips -- trimmed and cut into 1" pieces
  6        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  6               cups  onion -- coarsely chopped
  12             large  garlic cloves -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  2        tablespoons  ground cumin
  10              cups  low-salt chicken broth
  28            ounces  diced tomatoes in juice

Roast chiles. Peel, seed and cut into 1 inch pieces.

Place pork in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add flour and toss to coat. Heat 4 tablespoons oil in heavy large wide pot over high heat.

Reduce heat to medium. Add onions to pot and stir until tender, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, oregano and cumin; stir 2 minutes. Return pork and juice to pot. Add stock, chiles and tomatoes with juices and bring to a boil.

Reduce heat and simmer unconvered until chili thickens and meat is very tender, stirring occasionally about 2 hours. Season with salt and pepper.
