  6               ears  corn -- shucked
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2             slices  bacon -- minced
  1 1/4           cups  onion -- minced
  1                cup  red bell pepper -- minced
     1/2           cup  celery -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic -- minced
  6               cups  chicken broth
  3               cups  potato -- diced
  3               cups  tomato -- chopped, peeled and seeded
  4             ounces  green chiles -- chopped and drained
  1                cup  monterey jack cheese -- grated
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        tabasco sauce
  1                cup  corn tortilla strips -- toasted
  2        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped

Cut the corn kernels from the cobs with a sharp knife, capturing as much of the juice as possible. Reserve 3/4 cup of the kernels. Puree the remaining kernels with the cream and set aside.

Cook the bacon in a soup pot over medium high heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Add the onion, pepper, celery and garlic. Reduce heat to low and cover.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the broth, potatoes and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Skim any fat away and discard.
