  3               cups  pecans -- toasted and chopped
     1/2           cup  butter
     1/2           cup  shortening
  2               cups  sugar
  5              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1                cup  buttermilk

Sprinkle 2 cups pecans evenly into 3 buttered 9 inch rounds; shake to coat bottoms and sides of pans.

Beat 1/2 cup butter and shortening at medium speed until fluffy; gradually add sugar, beating well. Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating until blended after each one. Stir in vanilla.

Add flour and baking soda alternatively with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour. Beat at low speed after each addition. Stir in remaining 1 cup pecans.

Beat egg whites at medium speed until stiff peaks form; fold 1/3 of whites into batter. Fold in remaining whites.

Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until done. Cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Invert layers onto wax paper lined racks. Brush tops and sides of layers with corn syrup, and cool competely.

Spread half of pie mixture on 1 layer, pecan side up. Place second layer, pecan side up, on filling. Spread remaining on top. Top with 3rd layer, pecans up.
