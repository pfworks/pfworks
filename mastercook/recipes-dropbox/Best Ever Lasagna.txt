  6             ounces  tomato paste
  2                     28 oz cans crushed tomatoes
  6               cups  water
  1                cup  basil -- chopped
  2 1/4      teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              pound  Italian sausage
  4                     Italian sausage link
  16            ounces  whole milk ricotta cheese
  8               cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/4      teaspoon  dried basil
  12            sheets  no cook lasagna
  21            slices  provolone cheese
     1/3           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated

In a Dutch oven, cook onion in olive oil over medium heat until tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, 3-4 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, fresh basil, 2 tsp sugar and the salt. Bring to boil; reduce heat. Simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Cook bulk sausage in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink. Drain. Add meat to sauce and simmer 1 hour more.

Preheat oven to 350. Roast links 35-40 minutes. Cool and slice into 1/4" pieces.

Mix ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, egg, dried basil and remaining sugar.

In a greased 13x9 baking dish, spread 2 cups sauce. Arrange 4 noodles on top. Spread with a third of the ricotta mixture. Add seven slices of provolone, a third of the sausage links, and 1.5 cups mozzarella. Repeat twice using only 1 cup of sauce. Spread 2 cups sauce on top, and cover with remaining 2.5 cups mozzarella and parmesan.

Place dish on rimmed baking sheet and bake, uncovered, until bubbly and golden brown, 60-65 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes.
