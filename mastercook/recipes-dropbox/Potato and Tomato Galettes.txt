--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse salt
  3             medium  red potatoes (3" diameter) -- 1/8" thick rounds
  1             medium  tomato -- cut into 8 slices

Preheat oven to 400. Brush a baking sheet with oil; set aside. Stir thyme, oil, and salt in a medium bowl. Add potatoes; toss to coat.

Arrange potatoes on a prepared baking sheet, overlapping slices slightly in a spiral to make 4 rounds, about 5 inches in diameter each. Add tomatoes to bowl with oil; turn to coat. Place 2 tomato slices on top of each round. Bake until potatoes are tender and edges begin to brown, 15-22 minutes. Garnish with thyme sprigs.
