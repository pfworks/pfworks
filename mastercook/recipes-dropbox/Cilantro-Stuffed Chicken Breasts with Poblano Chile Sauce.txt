--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1                     garlic clove
  3        tablespoons  cilantro leaves -- chopped
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4              small  boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 4)
  2               cups  Poblano Chile Sauce
                        	

Preheat broiler and lightly brush a shallow baking pan with some oil.
Finely chop garlic and in a small bowl stir together with cilantro and
salt. Pat chicken dry and trim any fat.


To form a pocket in chicken for cilantro filling: Put a chicken breast
half on a cutting board and, beginning in middle of 1 side of breast
half, horizontally insert a sharp thin knife three fourths of the way
through center, moving knife in a fanning motion to create a pocket.
(Opening will only be about 1 inch wide.) Make pockets in remaining
chicken breast halves in same manner. Put about 1/2 tablespoon filling
into each pocket and with finger spread evenly. Transfer chicken to
baking pan and brush with remaining oil. Season chicken with salt and
pepper and broil 5 to 6 inches from heat 7 minutes. Turn chicken over
and broil until just cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes more.


Serve chicken with sauce.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     poblano pepper
  2                     garlic clove
  1              large  onion
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chicken broth

Lay whole peppers (chiles or bell peppers) on their sides on racks of
gas stove burners (preferably 1 to a burner) and turn flame on high.
Roast peppers, turning them, until skins are blistered and have brown
patches, 3 to 6 minutes. Do not overchar bell peppers; they will lose
their bright color. (Alternatively, peppers may be roasted in same
manner on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches
from heat.) Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until
cool enough to handle. Peel peppers (wear rubber gloves when handling
chiles). Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs. Chop peppers. Peppers
may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.


Chop garlic and chop enough onion to measure 1 cup. In a nonstick
skillet cook garlic and onion in oil over moderately low heat, stirring,
until softened. Skim fat from broth. Stir in broth and peppers and
simmer 1 minute. In a blender puree mixture until completely smooth (use
caution when blending hot liquids) and season with salt.
