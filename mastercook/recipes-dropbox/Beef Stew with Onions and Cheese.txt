  2          teaspoons  garlic -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
  2                 in  cinnamon stick
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  3        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  whole plum tomatoes -- peeled and seeded
     1/2           cup  tomato puree
  1         tablespoon  butter -- sliced and chilled
                        salt and pepper
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  24                    pearl onion
  1                cup  cheddar, monterrey jack or feta cheese -- crumbled or grated

Preheat oven to 325.

Heat the butter in a casserole or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Season the meat with salt and pepper and add to the butter. Saute, stirring occasionally, until meat is no longer red. Add garlic, bay leaf and cinnamon. Cover tightly and cook over low heat for 10 minutes.

Add the wine and vinegar. Cover tightly and place in oven. Continue to stew until meat is tender, about 1 hour.

Puree whole tomatoes until a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Add the puree and simmer for 10 more minutes. Scatter the butter over the top and swirl the pan until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.

Add the tomato sauce, sugar and onions to the stew; stir to combine. Return to oven until meat is very tender, about an hour.

Five minutes before serving, remove and discard bay leaf and cinnamon stick and stir in cheese. Serve in heated bowls.
