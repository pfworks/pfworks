     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- soft
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  4              large  egg
     3/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder or dutch-process
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
                        filling
     3/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2               cups  confectioner's sugar
  8        tablespoons  milk
                        coating
  2               cups  semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening

Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9x13 pan, line it with parchment paper, and spray the paper.

Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well and scraping. Add vanilla.

Whisk the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt through a strainer to break up any lumps.

Add half the dry ingredients to the egg mixture and mix.

Add buttermilk and mix. Scrape the bowl, and add remaining dry ingredients. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.

Level the top. Bake for 23 to 25 minutes until it springs back when lightly touched. Remove from oven and cool completely.

Place the peanut butter in a mixing bowl with the vanilla. Stir in the powdered sugar through a strainer, and mix at low speed until crumbly.

Add 4 tablespoons of the milk and mix at low speed until smooth. Stop and scrape. Add milk one tablespoon at a time until spreadable.

Remove cake from pan. Split into 2 layers.

Remove top layer and set aside.

Spread filling over bottom layer and replace top layer.

Cut the cake into thirds lengthwise.

Cut the cake into 9 1.5" bars. Pull apart slightly.

Melt the chocolate and shortening together at low power in the microwave. Stir until smooth.

Drizzle coating over the tops of the cakes; use a small spatula to spread over tops and sides.
