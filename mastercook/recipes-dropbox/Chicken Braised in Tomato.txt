  8                     bone-in thighs
                        salt and pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  yellow onion -- sliced thin or diced
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                     bay leaf
                        fresh chopped parsley and other fresh herbs on sprigs

  1                cup  chicken broth

Generously salt and pepper the chicken. Heat the oil on medium high until shimmering. In a deep, heavy saute pan place the chicken skin side down and brown for about 10 minutes. Turn and cook for 4 minutes. Remove chicken from pan and set aside. Discard some of the oil and fat from the pan leaving enough to saute onions. Cook until soft. Add garlic and herbs (except parsley which should be added at the end) and cook until fragrant, scraping up brown bits. Add tomatoea and stir. Arrange chicken in pan and pour in accumulated juices and broth. Bring to a boil the reduce to a low simmer. Cover and cook gently for 45 minutes. Remove bay leaf and fresh herb sprigs.
