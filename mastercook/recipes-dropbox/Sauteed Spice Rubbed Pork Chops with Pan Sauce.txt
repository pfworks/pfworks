--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Spice Rub
  2        tablespoons  paprika
  1         tablespoon  chile powder
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground sage
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly ground black pepper
                        Pan Sauce
  2          teaspoons  garlic -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  vermouth
     1/2           cup  chicken or beef stock
  1           teaspoon  chopped fresh herbs such as sage, rosemary, thyme, savory or dill
                        salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Make rub: Mix all rub ingredients together.

Coat the chops generously with spice rub and let marinate for up to 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. Let meat come to room temp before cooking. Scrape off excess rub and pat dry.

In a largem heavy skillet, heat the oil over high heat. When the pan is hot enough to sear the chops but not burn them, add the chops. They should make a gentle hissing sound. Sear chops for 1-2 minutes, until they begin to brown, then turn and sear for 1 more minute.

Reduce heat so the chops still sizzle. Cover pan and cook for 3-4 minutes more on other side. They should read 145. Remove chops, tent with foil and let rest 5 minutes.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan, leaving any meat juices. Adjust heat to medium and add garlic. Stir, cook for 30 seconds, then add remaining ingredients, scraping bottom of pan. Bring sauce to a boil and cook until it turns syrupy. Put chops back in pan and turn several times in sauce. Serve chops with remaining sauce.
