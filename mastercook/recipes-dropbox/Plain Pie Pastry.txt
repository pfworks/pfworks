--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
  7        tablespoons  cold whole milk

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until it is the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the milk over part of the flour mixture. Gently toss with a fork and push to the side. Sprinkle another over another dry part, toss and push to the side. Repeat until all the flour mixture is moistened.

Press the dough together to form 2 balls, then flatten into disks. Roll out the crusts right away, or wrap the dough tightly, smoothing out wrinkles or air pockets and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to a thickness of 1/8". Use a light touch and handle the dough as little as possible.

To prebake, preheat oven to 400. Press one rolled out crust into a 9 or 10 inch pie plate. Line with parchment paper and weigh down with beans or pie weights. Bake for 10 minutes. Take out of oven and carefully remove the weights. Place back in oven. Remove after 10 to 20 minutes, when it starts to turn golden to parbake. To fully bake continue for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown.
