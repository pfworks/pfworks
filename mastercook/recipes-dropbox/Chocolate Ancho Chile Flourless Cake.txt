  2             sticks  unsalted butter
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder -- sifted
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6              large  egg
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  powdered sugar
  1              pinch  cinnamon

Preheat oven to 350.

Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan. Line the bottom with parchment paper and butter the paper. Set aside.

In the top of a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter over medium low heat. Remove from heat and whisk in cocoa, chile powder and salt.

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar until thick and pale yellow in color Fold the chocolate mixture into the yolks and mix well.

In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until thick. Whisking, add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar gradually and continue to beat to form a light meringue. In several additions, fold into the chocolate mixture, being careful not to deflate the meringue. Gently pour into the prepared pan and bake until the edges are set but the center is still moist and a few crumbs stick to tester, about 45 minutes.

Remove from oven and cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.

Run a thin, sharp knife around the edge of cake. Remove the pan sides and gently lift away from the cake. Invert onto a cake plate, remove the bottom and peel away parchment.

In a bowl, beat the cream with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the powdered sugar and cinnamon and continue to beat until the cream holds soft peaks.

To serve, slice the cake with a portion of whipped cream. Garnish with cocoa powder and serve.
