                        Crust
  1 1/4         pounds  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  sugar
  3                     extra large egg
     3/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        Topping
  1              pound  unsalted butter
  1                cup  honey
  3               cups  light brown sugar -- packed
  1           teaspoon  grated lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  grated orange zest
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  2             pounds  pecans -- coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 350.

For the crust, beat the butter and sugar in an electric mixer with a paddle until light, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix dry ingredients into the batter and mix on low speed until just combined. Press the dough evenly into an ungreased 18x12x1 baking sheet, making an edge around the outside. It will be very sticky; sprinkle dough and hands lightly with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, until the crust is set, but not browned. Allow to cool. 

Combine butter, honey, brown sugar, and zests in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over low heat until the butter is melted, using a wooden spoon to stir. Raise the heat and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in heavy cream and pecans. Pour over the crust, trying not to get the filling between the crust and the pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the filling is set. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until cold. Cut into bars and serve.
