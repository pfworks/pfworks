  2             pounds  ground beef
     1/4         pound  ground pork shoulder
  1              large  spanish onion -- chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded and chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  28            ounces  canned tomatoes with juice
  1                cup  ginger ale
  1              small  hot red chili pepper -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  chile powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano -- crumbled
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  20            ounces  can kidney beans -- drained

In a large heavy pot, brown the beef and pork, stirring until no pink remains in beef. Pour off most of the grease. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic and cook, stirring until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice, ginger ale, red chile pepper, chile powder, cumin, oregano, dry mustard, salt, and pepper and stir well. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook 1 hour. Add beans and simmer 1 to 1.5 hours longer, stirring from time to time.

Garnish with cheese and onions.
