--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  chicken stock
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1              large  ripe tomato -- peeled, seeded and roughly chopped
     1/2        medium  white onion -- roughly chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- peeled
  2        tablespoons  ancho or pasilla chile puree
  4             ounces  chorizo
  4        tablespoons  canola oil
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  2        tablespoons  fresh cilantro -- chopped

Bring the stock and salt to a simer in a medium saucepan; lower the heat and keep the stock hot. Put the tomato, onion, garlic, chile puree, and a few tablespoons of the stock into a blender or food processor and blend to a puree. Remove the chorizo from its casing, and fry in a small skillet until browned, breaking up the meat with a fork. Drain the cooked chorizo on paper toweling and set aside.

In a large, heavy saucepan with a close-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium high heat and stir the rice into the hot oil. Saute the rice in the oil, stirring constantly, until it is translucent and golden, about 8 minutes. Scrape the tomato-chile puree into the saucepan with the rice and cook, stirring, for 3 or 4 minutes. Do not let the rice scorch. Pour the hot stock into the rice, quickly stir in the chorizo, cover the saucepan, and cut the heat to low. Cook the rice for about 20 minutes, or until the rice grains are tender and the liquid has been absorbed. Sprinkle each serving with chopped cilantro.
