  2 1/4           cups  apple cider
  1 1/2    tablespoons  pure maple syrup
  2 1/2    tablespoons  dijon mustard
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs from crustless French bread coarsely ground in processor

Stir 2 cups water and 1/3 cup coarse salt in medium saucepan over medium heat until salt dissolves. Remove from heat. Add syrup, garlic, sage, bay leaves and peppercorns. Add 2 cups ice water; cool brine to room temperature. Place roast in large reselable freezer bag; place bag in large pot. Pour brine into bag; seal bag. Place in refrigerator and brine overnight.

Remove pork from brine; discard brine. Let pork stand 1 hour at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 325. Place first 4 ingredients on heavy 18x12x1 inch rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with 3 tbspns of oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Push mixture to sides of sheet to make room for roast.

Heat remaining 1 tbspn oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Pat pork dry. Place roast, fat side down, in skillet and cook until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer roast, browned side up, to center of baking sheet.

Add apple cider to dripping in skillet. Boil cider until reduced to 1 cup, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour reduced cider over apple-onion mixture. Mix maple syrup and 1.5 tbspnd mustard in small bowl for glaze. Brush half of glaze over browned side of prok.

Roast pork until 140F, brushing every 45 minutes with remaining glaze, about 2 hours total. Transfer pork to work surface and let rest 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir melted butter and remaining 1 tbspn mustard in medium bowl. Add breadcrumbs and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Spread out on small rimmed baking sheet. Increase oven temp to 375F.

Bake breadcrumbs until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Cut pork into scant 1/2" thick slices off bone. Divide among plates. Using slotted spoon, divide apple onion mixture among plates. Pour juices from baking sheet into small pitcher. Sprinkle mustard breadcrumbs over pork and serve, passing juices alongside.
