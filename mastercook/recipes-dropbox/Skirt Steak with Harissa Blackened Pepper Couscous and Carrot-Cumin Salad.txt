  2             pounds  skirt steak
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        olive oil
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil (for frying)
                        Harissa
     1/2           cup  butter
  3                     serrano pepper -- halved and seeded
  1                     red or orange bell pepper -- halved and seeded
                        olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled and crushed
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed
  1           teaspoon  caraway seed
  1           teaspoon  whole coriander
  3        tablespoons  lemon juice
                        mint leaves -- coarsely chopped

Salt steak and let it come to room temperature. Rub with oil before cooking.

Clarify the butter (you should have clarified the butter) by metling it slowly in a small pot over very low heat. Once it has simmered for several minutes, skim off any cloudy liquid from the top, then pour off the clear butter slowly. Stop pouring when you reach milky sediment. You need about 1/3 cup.

Preheat oven to 450. Smear chiles and peppers with oil inside and out and roast for 10 minutes or until browned and blistered. Remove from oven to cool, then peel off skins, then chop and set aside.

Crush garlic and salt to form a paste. Toast cumin and caraway until fragrant, and then add them, along with coriander, to the garlic mixture. Put garlic mixture in a fod processor with chopped chiles and bell pepper. Pulse, then add in lemon juice. WIth machine on, slowly pour in clarified butter.

Grill the steak for 2-3 minutes per side, then move it to cooler part of grill to finish. Pan-fry for 3 minutes per side, and then finish off over lower heat for 2-5 minutes. Tent for 5 minutes.

Slice steak across grain, creating long, thin pieces. Smear with harissa, garnish with mint leaves, and serve with couscous and carrot salad.
