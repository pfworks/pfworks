  2                     boneless strip steaks (1 lb each, 1.5 to 1.75" thick)
                        kosher salt
                        ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Cut each steak in half to create four steaks. Season entire surface of steaks liberally with salt and pepper; gently press steaks until 1.5" thick. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer sheet to oven. Cook until 90-95, about 20-25 minutes.

Heat oil in 12" heavy skiller over high heat until smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear until browned and crusty, about 1.5 to 2 minutes, lifting halfway through to redistribute fat. Turn steak and cook another 2-2.5 minutes. Transfer all steaks to wire cooling rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Using tongs, stand 2 steaks on side, and holding together, sear on all sides for about 1.5 minutes.

Transfer to rack, tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes while making pan sauce.
