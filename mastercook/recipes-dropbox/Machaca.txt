  3             quarts  water
     3/4           cup  Garlic Puree
  6             pounds  roast beef -- shredded
                        juice of 2 limes
     1/3           cup  oil
  1                cup  anaheim chili pepper -- roasted and chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/2                white onion -- sliced into rings
  2                     tomatoes -- chopped

In an 8 qt stockpot, bring the water to a boil. Add 1/4 cup garlic puree and the meat and return to a boil. Skim off the froth, reduce the heat, and simmer for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender. Remove the froth as needed. Drain and reserve the juices.

To brown and dry the meat, combine the lime juice and 1/4 cup garlic puree. Preheat the oven to 375. Spread the shredded meat in a single layer on a large cookie sheet and sprinkle with the lime juice mixed with garlic puree. Roast the meat until brown and as dry as you choose, at least 15 minutes, and up to one hour, stirring occasionally.

To fry the meat, heat the oil in a large skillet. Saute the chile peppers with the salt and pepper. Add the onion and tomatoes and saute briefly; then add the remaining 1/4 cup garlic puree. Add the meat, stirring over medium heat to brown. If too dry, add some of the reserved juices.
