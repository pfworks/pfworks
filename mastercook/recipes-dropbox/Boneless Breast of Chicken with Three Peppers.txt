--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  green bell pepper -- diced
  1                cup  red bell pepper -- diced
  1                cup  yellow bell pepper -- diced
                        salt
                        black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  boneless chicken
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  flat leaf parsley -- finely chopped

Put the onion, 2 tbs of butter, and 1 tbs of vege oil in a skillet and place over med heat. Saute till the onion turns a rich gold.

While the onion is sauteing, dice the peppers. When the onion has turned golden, raise the heat to med-high and add all the peppers. Season with salt and pepper and cook until peppers are tender and start to brown.

While the peppers are cooking, fillet the chicken breasts. SLice them horizontally in half, or in thirds to get thin fillets.

Put the remaining butter and vege oil in another skillet over high heat. When the butter foam begins to subside, slide in as many chicken fillets as will fit. Cook on each side till it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to platter and season with salt and pepper. Keep the pan over high heat and add 1/4 cup water. Scrape the pan with a wooden spoon and reduce to a saucelike consistency. Set aside.

When the peppers are tender, add the deglazing liquid from the pan, the heavy cream and the parsley. Cook until reduced by half. Add fillets and cook until heated through.
