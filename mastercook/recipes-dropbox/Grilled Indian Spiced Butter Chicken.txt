--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  onion -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  garlic -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh ginger -- peeled and finely chopped
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
  1                     serrano pepper
  1           teaspoon  white distilled vinegar
     1/3           cup  thick plain yogurt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  ground turmeric
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  3             pounds  chicken -- quartered, backbone and skin removed
  1              stick  unsalted butter

Puree onion, garlic, ginger, salt, chile and vinegar to a smooth paste in a food processor. Transfer to a large wide bowl and whisk in yogurt, coriander, oil, turmeric and cayenne. Add chicken pieces and turn to coat thickly. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate, chilled, at least 16 hours. Let stand at room temp 30 minutes before serving.

Bring butter to a boil in a 1 qt heavy saucepan over moderate heat. When foam completely covers butter, reduce heat to very low. Cook butter until a very think crust begins to form on surface on milky white solids fall to bottom of pan, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook butter, watching constantly, until solids at bottom of pan turn light brown and butter has a nutty fragrance, 8 to 16 minutes.

Remove pan from heat and let butter stand 1 minute. Pour through a sieve lined with a dampened heavy duty paper towel or triple layer cheesecloth into a bowl, discarding solids.

Lightly grill oil rack. Put chicken (still coated with marinade) on rack over area of grill with no coals underneath. Drizzle chicken with about 1 tablespoon ghee. Cook chicken over med-high heat, turning and drizzling with ghee every 5 minutes, until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.

(Gas grill): Lightly oil grill rack. Put chicken over shut-off burner. Cook chicken, turning over and drizzling with ghee every 5 minutes, until cooked through, about 20 to 25 minutes. (Cover grill between turns).

Serve drizzled with remaining ghee.
