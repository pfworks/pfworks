  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        cream cheese filling
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  8             ounces  cream cheese -- softened
     1/2           cup  sugar

  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325.

Grease and flour a 9x13 baking pan.

To make the brownies: Melt the chocolate with the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer this mixture to a large bowl and set aside. Meanwhile, prepare the cream cheese filling.

To make the filling: In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat the butter and cream cheese for 2 to 3 minutes until smooth. Beat in the sugar and then the eggs, one at a time. Add in the vanilla, set aside.

Beat the remaining ingredients in the cooled chocolate mixture, in listed order, until smooth. Spread half the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan, then all of the cream cheese mixture, then the remaining chocolate mixture. Swirl the chocolate into the cream cheese batter wuth the tip of a sharp knife to form a decorative pattern.

Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a tester comes out clean. Let cool before cutting and serving.
