                        sauce
  20                    chilitepins -- crushed
  15                    dried red new mexican chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3             cloves  garlic
  1           teaspoon  vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  flour
                        tortillas
  2               cups  masa harina
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
                        vege oil
                        garnish
  2               cups  queso blanco or monterey jack -- grated
                        shredded lettuce minced green onions

Combine chiles, salt, and enough water to cover in a saucepan. Boil for 10-15 minutes, or until the chiles are quite soft. Allow the chiles to cool, and puree them in a blender along with the garlic. Strain the mixture, mash the pulp through a strainer, and discard the skins. Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the flour and brown, taking care to not burn. Add the chile puree and boil for 5-10 minutes, until thickened slightly. Set aside and keep warm.

Mix the masa, egg, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl, adding enough water to make a dough. Using a tortilla press, make the tortillas. Deep fry each one until it puffs up and turns slightly brown. Drain on paper towels and keep warm.

Place a tortilla on each plate, top with sauce and garnish.
