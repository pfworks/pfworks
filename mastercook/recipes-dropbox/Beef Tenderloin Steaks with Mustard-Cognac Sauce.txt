  6                     beef tenderloin steaks -- 7-8 oz - 1.5" thick
                        coarse kosher salt
                        cracked black pepper
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  6        tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- divided
  4             cloves  garlic -- smashed
  2                     fresh thyme sprigs
  2                     fresh rosemary sprig
			
  1                cup  shallot -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  cognac
  2        tablespoons  tawny Port
  3               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard

Preheat oven to 350. Sprinkle steaks on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in heavy large skillet over high heat. Add steaks and sear until brown, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add 3 tablespoons butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to skillet. Cook steaks to desired doneness, turning occasionally and basting with pan juices, about 12 minutes for medium-rare.

Transfer steaks to small rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven.

Pour contents of skillet into small bowl. Return 3 tablespoons drippings from bowl to same skillet and place over high heat. Add shallots and saute 2 minutes. Add Cognac and Port and stir 1 minute, scraping up any browned bits. Add broth and boil until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, about 12 minutes. Whisk in mustard, then remaining 3 tablespoons cold butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Arrange steaks on plates; whisk any accumulated juices from baking sheet into sauce. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
