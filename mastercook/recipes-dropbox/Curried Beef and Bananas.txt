--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                     onion -- chopped
  1              pound  sirloin steak -- diced
  3              small  serrano pepper -- stemmed and seeded, chopped
                        salt
  1         tablespoon  Malawi Curry Powder
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground cloves
  3              large  tomatoes -- chopped
  3               cups  water
  4                     unripe bananas -- quartered lengthwise and cut into 2-inch slices

Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the onion until it is light brown, about 5 minutes. Add the steak and saute for 1 minute, then add the chiles, salt, Malawi Curry Powder, and cloves. Saute for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.

Add the tomatoes and the water and simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be reduced considerably. Add the bananas and cook until both the meat and bananas are tender, 20 minutes or more.

Serve with rice.
