  4             pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- cut into 4 equal pieces
                        kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  bacon fat or vegetable oil
  1                     yellow onion -- roughly chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- smashed and peeled
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
  1           teaspoon  coriander seed -- toasted and ground
  1                     cinnamon stick
  3                     dried chiles -- stemmed and roughly chopped
  2               cups  chicken stock
                        freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 250.

Sprinkle pork evenly with kosher salt.

Heat a Dutch oven over med-high heat. Add the oil. When it's hot, add two of the pork pieces. Brown all sides to a nice brown crust. Transfer to a plate and repeat with other pieces.

Reduce heat to medium and add onion, garlic, cumin and coriander, cinnamon stick and chiles. Stir around for a few minutes, then pour in stock. Arrange pork on top of veges and bring to a simmer. Cover and transfer to oven.

Bake the pork for 2-3 hours, or until fork-tender. Remove from oven and transfer pork to cutting board. Let cool while the sauce is finished. Remove cinnamon stick from pan and discard. With an immersion blender, puree the pan juices in the pan until mostly smooth. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste, and keep warm.

Pull the pork apart into bite sized pieces and add back to the pan. Serve the pork warm with pan juices.
