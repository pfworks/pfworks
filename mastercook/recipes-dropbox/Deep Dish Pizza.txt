  14                in  round pizza pan, 2 inches deep
                        dough
  1 1/2       packages  active dry yeast
     1/2           cup  warm water -- 105-115
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  warm water
                        topping
  28            ounces  6-1 brand tomatoes (or italian style plum tomatoes)
  1           teaspoon  dried basil
  1           teaspoon  oregano
                        salt
  10            ounces  mozzarella cheese -- thinly sliced
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
     1/2         pound  Italian sausage -- casing removed
                        olive oil

Dough: Dissolve the yeast in the 1/2 cup of warm water. Add the sugar and stir well. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour, salt and cornmeal. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add the yeast mixture, the vegetable oil, and the 1/2 cup of water. Stir and mix thoroughly until the dough cleans the sides of the bowl and a rough mass is formed.

Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a well-floured work surface. Knead and pound the dough (dust with flour if sticky) for 5-6 minutes until it is smooth and soft. Dust the dough and a large mixing bowl lightly with flour. Place the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1.5 hours.

After the dough has doubled in bulk, turn it out of the bowl and knead it for about 2 minutes. Oil the bottom and sides of the pizza pan. Spread the dough in the pan with fingers and palm. (it will spread more evenly if you let it sit in pan for about 10 minutes) Work the dough until it covers the bottom of the pan. Pull the edges up to form a lip or a pronounced border all around the pan. Preheat oven to 475. Prick the dough bottom with a fork at 1/2" intervals and parbake the crust for exactly 4 minutes in preheated oven. Brush crust lightly with oil.

Topping: In a large mixing bowl, combine tomatoes, basil, oregano and salt. Set aside.

Assemble and bake: Lay the slices of mozarella cheese evenly over the crust (not the border). Spoon the tomatoes over the cheese. Sprinkle the grated parmesan over the tomatoes. Next add the Italian sausage - flatten the sausage pieces (about the size of a half dollar) between thumb and forefinger and distribute evenly over the tomatoes. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon olive oil on top.

Bake the pizza in a preheated 475 oven on the bottom rack for 5 minutes; move the pizza to an oven rack 2 slots higher and bake an additional 30 minutes, until crust is lightly browned and sausage is cooked through.

If using plum tomatoes, drain liquid, put tomatoes in mixing bowl, crush them by hand and add seasonings.

Add other toppings before baking.
