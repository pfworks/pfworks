  1         tablespoon  softened butter
                        gruyere cheese -- shredded, enough to cover both sides

Heat oil in frying pan over med-low heat. Add butter and allow to melt.

Spread each slice of bread with softened butter. Add half the cheese to one, pile braised onions on top, sprinkle with fresh thyme, salt and pepper and add the rest of cheese. Top with bread and press together.

Place sandwich in the hot pan and cook until bread is toasted brown and cheese has started to melt. Flip pan over in the pan and cook until toasted brown and completely melted.

Onions: Cut in half lengthwise, then slice thinly lengthwise.

For every 1 onion, heat 1 tspn oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the same amount of butter, allow to melt, and add garlic. Add to soften, then add onions. Stir to coat, add a bay leaf and a sprig of thyme, then turn down heat to med-low. Continue to cook until onions are soft and deep golden brown, 30-40 minutes.

Add 1/4 cup wine and allow to cook down with onions, another 5-7 minutes.
