--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  heavy cream -- chilled
  3              large  eggs
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  water
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- melted and cooled
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- 1/2" cubes and softened
  1                     9 inch pie crust -- baked and cooled

With electric mixer on med-high speed, whip cream to stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to small bowl and refrigerate.

Combine eggs, sugar, and water in a large heatproof bowl set over medium saucepan filled with 1/2" barely simmering water. With electric mixer on medium speed, beat until egg mixture is thickened and registers 160 degrees, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and continue to beat egg mixture until fluffy and cooled to room temperature, about 8 minutes.

Add chocolate and vanilla to cool egg mixture and beat until incorporated. Beat in butter, a few pieces at a time, until well combined. Using spatula, fold in whipped cream until no streaks of white remain. Scrape into pie shell and refrigerate until set, 3-24 hours.
