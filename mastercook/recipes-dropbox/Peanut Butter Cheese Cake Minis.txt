  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  4        tablespoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  butter -- melted
  12                    bite-size peanut butter cups
                        Filling
  16            ounces  cream cheese -- room temp
  1                cup  sugar

Preheat oven to 350. Place a paper cupcake liner in each cup of a standard muffin pan.

To make crust, in a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press crust into bottom of each muffin cop. Put 1 peanut butter cup into the center of each crust.

Beat cream cheese with a mixer until fluffy. Add sugar, flour, and vanilla, beating well. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each one. Spoon mixture into cups. Bake until set, about 20 minutes. Cool completely.
