  1              pound  chicken tenderloins
     1/2           cup  beer
  1              pound  elbow macaroni
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  whole milk
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  34         teaspoons  black pepper
  3               cups  white cheddar -- grated
  3               cups  mozzarella cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  gruyere cheese
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  Frank's red hot
  1                cup  panko bread crumbs

Preheat oven to 400. Coat bottom and sides of a 13x9 baking dish with butter.

Arrange bacon on an aluminum foil lined sheet pan and bake until crisp, about 22 minutes. Allow to cool and coarsely chop.

Put chicken and beer in a large bowl and let marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Add macaroni and cook until al dente. Drain and reserve.

Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; whisk in the garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden. Whisk in 1/3 cup flour and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Whisk in 3 cups milk, the salt and pepper, and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Add 2 cups of the CHeddar and 2 cups of the mozzarella and stir until melted, about 2 minutes.

Stir the cheese sauce, gruyere and bacon into the macaroni until well combined; pour into the baking dish and smooth surface.

Put the remaining 1 cup flour in a medium sized mixing bowl. In another bowl, add the remaining 2 tablespoons milk and the egg and whisk until combined. Drain beer from chicken and dip into the flour to coat well, then dip into the egg mixture and back into the flour. Put on a plate until ready to fry.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until hot. Working in 2 batches, fry the chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels and drain. Add chicken and hot sauce to a large bowl and toss until well coated. Carefully slice into bite sized strips.

Evenly top the macaroni with the sliced chicken and drizzle with additional hot sauce. Sprinkle 1 cup of white cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarela over top of the chicken and sprinkle with the panko bread crumbs. Melt the remaiining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle evenly over bread crumbs. Bake at 400 until golden brown and bubbly, about 25-30 minutes.

Cool 10 minutes.
