  4                     pork chops -- 1.5" thick
                        corn oil
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
			
                        peach mustard bbq sauce
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  onion -- minced
  3        tablespoons  cider vinegar
     1/2           cup  whole grain mustard
     1/4           cup  dijon mustard
     3/4           cup  peach preserves
  1         tablespoon  bourbon
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Prepare grill with high heat for both direct and indirect grilling. Position a drip pan under grate on cool side.

Brush chops on both sides with oil and season with salt and pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.

Grill chops over the heat until brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Move them to cool side of the grill and brush with some of the BBQ sauce. Cook the chops, covered, turning and basting with sauce every 5 minutes, until a thermometer registers 140, about 15 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes.

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and boil until almost completely reduced and the mixture looks like wet sand, about 4 minutes. Whisk in both mustards and the preserves. Simmer, whisking, until jam melts, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in bourbon and salt.
