  3        tablespoons  lard
  2             pounds  boneless pork loin -- 1" cubes
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- seeded and thinly sliced
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  dry white wine
                        beef broth
                        salt and pepper
  1              pound  shelled pecans

In a large, heavy saucepan or pot, melt the lard over moderate heat, add the pork, and brown on all sides, stirring. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and stir till they soften, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle flour over top and stir 1 minute. Add the wine plus enough broth to cover and season with salt and pepper. Bring to low boil, reduce heat, cover, and braise for about 45 minutes. Add pecans, stor, and braise till pork is fork tender and sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes.
