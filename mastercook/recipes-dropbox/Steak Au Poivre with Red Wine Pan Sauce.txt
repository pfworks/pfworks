  4                     boneless beef sirloin steaks at least 1 inch thick -- trimmed
                        salt
  1         tablespoon  cracked black pepper
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        pan sauce
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
     1/2                red onion -- finely chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  beef stock
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  water -- combined with cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  flat leaf parsley -- chopped
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper

Slash the edges of the steaks in 1 or 2 places to prevent curling. Sprinkle all sides generously with salt and cracked pepper, pressing the pepper into the surface of the meat. Let the steaks stand at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before cooking.

In a large, heavy frying pan over med-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the steaks and cook to the desired doneness, turning once, 3-5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a platter and let rest, tented loosely with aluminum foil, while you make the sauce.

To make the sauce, in the same pan over med-high heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is softened, 3-5 minutes. Add the wine and stock and boil until reduced by 1/2, 4-5 minutes. Reduce heat to med, whisk in the tomato paste and cornstarch mixture, and simmer, whisking occassionally, until slightly thickened, 3-5 minutes. Add more stock if too thick. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper.

Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
