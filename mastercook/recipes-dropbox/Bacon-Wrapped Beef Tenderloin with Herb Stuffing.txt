--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter
  6             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  4               cups  fresh breadcrumbs made from crustless french bread
  2 1/2           cups  chopped fresh parsley (2-3 large bunches)
  2 1/2         pounds  center-cut beef tenderloin roast -- get 2 of them
  24            slices  bacon
                        canola oil

Melt butter in large pot over medium heat. Add garlic; saute 2 minutes. Add breadcrumbs. Saute until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat; mix in parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Cool completely.

Starting at 1 long side, cut each tenderloin lengthwise almost in half, stopping about 1/2 inch from opposite long side. Open tenderloins like books. Sprinkle cut sides with salt and pepper. Pack half of stuffing on 1 side of each tenderloin. Fold plain side over stuffing.

Slightly overlap half of bacon slices on sheet of parchment paper, forming rectangle equal in length to 1 tenderloin. Place tenderloin at 1 edge, across bacon ends. Using parchment as aid, roll up tenderloin in bacon. Using kitchen string, secure bacon around tenderloin, tying at 1.5" intervals, then tie once lengthwise. Repeat with remaining bacon and tenderloin. (Can be refrigerated for 1 day, let stand at room temp for 1 hour)

Preheat oven to 400. Pour enough oil into large skillet to coat bottom; heat over high heat. Add 1 tenderloin. Saute until bacon is brown, turning often, about 10 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with second tenderloin. Roast until thermometer inserted into center of each registers 135, about 30 minutes. Transfer to platter. Let stand 15 minutes. Cut off strings and cut into 1/2" thick slices.
