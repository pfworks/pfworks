Preheat oven to 375

In a saute pan, melt butter over medium heat. When melted, add onion and celery and cook for 7 to 8 minutes of until tender and just beginning to brown.

Stir in the thyme, garlic and paprika and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute just until fragrant. Reduce the heat to low, add the tomato juice and cook for another 3 minutes, or until sauce thickens a little. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the chicken broth and eggs. Stir in the crackers, parsley, soy sauce, mustard, salt and pepper. Spoon tomato sauce into the bowl and stir until incorporated.

Add the beef and cheese to the bowl and mix gently but thoroughly with a wooden spoon or your hands. Transfer mixture to a 12x8x3 pan and shape into a loaf that fits the pan.

Bake in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until 140.

Spread cocktail sauce over top and bake for about 15 minutes longer, until it is a glaze. Remove and cover with aluminum foil and let rest 10 minutes.
