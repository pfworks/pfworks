  2             pounds  flank steak
  1                cup  flat leaf parsley -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  baby arugula -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
  1               loaf  brioche pullman or white pullman
     1/4           cup  mayonnaise
  1                     beefsteak or heirloom tomato -- sliced
                        soft butter

Place parsley thru vinegar into a bowl, stir to combine. For the steak, cover both sides of the steak with some of the chimichurri, put in ziplock bag and refrigerate for one or two hours. Cover and refrigerate the rest of the chimichurri.

Remove steak from refrigerator approximately 45 minutes before cooking. Scrape off some of the chimichurri, salt the steak and let rest. Slice tomatoes, slice bread into 1 inch thick slices, mix 2 tablespoons of mayo and chimichurri.

To sear the steak: First pat dry. In a very hot pan lay steak, let it sear without disturbing it on each side. Remove from pan, lay on cutting board, pepper the steak, and let rest 5-10 minutes.

Grill buttered bread in hot pan.

Slice steak thinly across the grain. Spread chimichurri mayo on each side of bread, lay meat, tomato and then top of bread.
