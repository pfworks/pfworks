  1         tablespoon  whole white peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander
  4 1/2    tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  ground nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  ground clove
  3 1/2    tablespoons  unsweetened cocoa
  4        tablespoons  gray sea salt
  2                     boneless pork tenderloins
  2                tgb  extra virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 400 degrees

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, toast white peppercorns and coriander seeds untill they begin to pop. Remove from heat and grind to a fine powder. Mix with remaining spices, cocoa and salt.

Trim tenderloins of fat and silver skin. Rub with a generous amount of spice rub. Heat the olive oil in a large sauce pan over medium high heat until hot but not smoking. Sear each tenderloin on all sides until a rich brown color, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from heat and finish in the oven for about 10 minutes or until cooked  through.

Let tenderloins rest out of the oven for at least 10 minutes before carving.
