--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     dried guajillo or New Mexico chile
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper flakes
     3/4           cup  cilantro -- chopped
     1/4           cup  fresh oregano -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  finely grated lime zest
     1/4           cup  olive oil
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  4             pounds  chicken -- halved, backbone removed
                        lime wedges

Toast whole chile in a dry skillet until puffy and darkened, about 4 minutes. Stem and seed. Finely chop and transfer to a small bowl. Add chile flakes, cilantro, oregano, lime zest, and 1/4 cup oil; season with salt and pepper.

Prepare grill for medium indirect heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and place skin-side down on grill. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is crisp and browned and 165 in the thigh. About 5 minutes before done, baste with some of the dressing.

Pour remaining dressing onto a carving board and place chicken, skin side up, on top. Let sit at least 10 minutes to reset and absorb dressing before carving. Drizle with dressing from board and serve with lime wedges.
