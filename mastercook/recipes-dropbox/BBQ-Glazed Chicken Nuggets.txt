     1/4           cup  molasses
     1/4           cup  packed dark brown sugar

                        Nuggets
  2               cups  all-purpose flour

Pour cider vinegar into a small saucepan and whisk in garlic powder, onion powder and chile powder. Bring to a boil and add worcestershire sauce, ketchup, molasses, brown sugar and honey. Lower heat to medium or medium low and allow to bubble and thicken.

Preheat oven to 425. In a plastic bag shake together flour, salt, and pepper. Add nuggets in batches to coat. Place on a foil lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes, then coat each piece with glaze and bake for 5 to 10 more minutes. Serve additional glaze on side.
