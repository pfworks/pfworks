                        Frosting
  3             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
                        cake
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  11       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
     2/3           cup  Dutch-process cocoa powder
  2              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/3           cups  warm water

Cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325. Grease the sides and bottom of a 9x3 springform pan. Dust with flour.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a medium bowl. Whisk until well blended and set aside.

In the bowl of a mixer with paddle, beat the butter at medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Gradually add the sugar and beat at high speed unti the mixture is pale and well blended, about 3 minutes. Add the cocoa powder and beat and medium speed for 1 minute, scraping sides as needed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each additino. Beat in vanilla extract. At low speed, add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the water in 2 additions. Scrape down bowl and mix at low speed for 30 seconds. Pour batter into pan

Bake the cake for 45 to 55 minutes until a cake tester is clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes.

Remove the side of the pan and invert onto rack. Remove bottom and cool completely. Frost.

Frosting: Put both chocolates in a medium stainless steel bowl and place the bowl over a pot of barely simmering water. Heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted. Remove the bowl from the pot and set the chocolate aside to cool until tepid.

In the bowl of an electric mixer with paddle, beat the butter at medium speed until creamy, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the sugar and beat at high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the cooled chocolate at low speed, mixing until blended and scraping down sides. Increase the speed to high and beat until slightly aerated, about 1 minute.
