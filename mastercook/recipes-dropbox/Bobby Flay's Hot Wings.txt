--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        peanut oil
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
  3             pounds  chicken wings -- split at the joint, tips removed
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  pureed chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
  1         tablespoon  new mexico chile powder
  1         tablespoon  dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1              stick  unsalted butter

Heat 2 inches of peanut oil in a large high-sided pan until a thermometer registers 375.

Stir together the flour, salt and pepper, 1 tablespoon ancho powder and the garlic powder in a shallow bowl. Season the wings with salt and pepper and add in batches to the flour mixture to lightly coat. Tap off the excess flour, add the wings to the oil in batches and fry until golden brown and cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate.

Bring the vinegar, chipotle puree, the remaining 2 tablespoons ancho powder and the NM chile powder to a simmer in a large, high sided saute pan over medium heat. Remove from heat and whisk in the mustard, 1 teaspoon salt, the honey and butter until smooth. Add the wings and toss to coat.
