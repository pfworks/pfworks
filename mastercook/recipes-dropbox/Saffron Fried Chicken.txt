--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  buttermilk
  1              pinch  saffron
  2                     egg
  3             cloves  garlic -- 1/2" cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  4             pounds  broiler chicken -- cut into 8 pieces
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
     1/4      teaspoon  onion powder
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1              pinch  cayenne
                        vegetable oil for frying

In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of buttermilk until it comes up to a shimmer. Add the saffron and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.

Pour this mixture along with the remaining buttermilk and the rest of the marinade ingredients into a blender and blend on high until smooth.

Place the chicken in a bowl or casserole dish and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours.

In a large bowl, combine the next 8 ingredients thoroughly. Remove the chiken from the marinade and place in a colander for a few minutes to drain, reserving the marinade. Dredge or shake the chiken pieces individually in the flour mixture and place on wire rack over baking sheet.

Dip the chicken once more in the marinade, letting excess drip off. Coat again in the flour mixture and place back on the wire rack. Let the chiken sit on the rack for 1 hour to dry and come to room temperature.

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat 2 inches of oil to 350 degrees.

Place the chicken in the hot oil and fry for 13-17 minutes, making sure the oil temperature stays at 325.

Serve hot!
