  4                     bone-in pork chops, about 12 oz each
  1             gallon  warm water
  1 3/4           cups  kosher salt
  1 1/2           cups  honey
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  freshly ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground clove
                        creole mustard sauce
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  minced shallot
     1/2      teaspoon  chopped garlic
  1                cup  dry red wine
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  creole mustard

Heat oil in a medium pot over med-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic and ook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the wine. Stir and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to med-low and simmer until reduced to a thick glaze, 18-20 minutes. Add the chicken stock and mustard, stir well, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Remove from heat cover and keep warm until ready to serve.

Preheat oven to 350.

Heat the water, salt, and honey in a stockpot. Stir to dissolve honey and salt. Remove from the heat. Add the thyme, pepper and cloves and refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours. Once cool, submerge the pork chops in the brining liquid. Marinate for 2 hours, refrigerated.

Heat a large, heavy non-stick pan over med-high heat. Add the chops in batches, as necessary, and sear on each side, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a roasting pan and roast until cooked, about 18 minutes.

Serve with sauce.
