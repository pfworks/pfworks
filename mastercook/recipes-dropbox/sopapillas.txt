--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  lukewarm water
     1/4           cup  milk -- room temp
                        vegetable oil for frying

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt and baking powder. Pour in the oil and mix with your fingertips to combine. Add the water and milk, working the liquids in until a sticky dough forms.

Lightly dust a counter or pastry board with flour and knead the dough vigorously for 1 minute. The mixture should be soft and no longer sticky. Let the dough rest, covered, with a damp cloth , for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 3 balls, cover the balls with the damp cloth, and let them rest another 15-30 minutes.

Lightly dust a counter or pastry board again with flour and roll out each ball of dough into a circle or oval approximately 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Trim off ragged edges and discard. Cut each circle of dough into 4 wedges.

In a heavy, high sided saucepan or skillet, heat the oil to 400 F. Carefully transfer 2-3 wedges to the oil. After sinking briefly, the sopapillas should begin to balloon and rise to the surface. Spoon some oil over the tops of the sopapillas. When the top surfaces are fully puffed, a matter of seconds, turn the sopapillas. Cook until light golden, and drain.
