                        salt
                        cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  flour
  1                cup  yellow onion -- finely diced
     1/2           cup  celery -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  bell pepper -- finely chopped
  2                     bay leaf
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1             bottle  dark lager
  1              quart  cold chicken stock
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
     1/4           cup  hot sauce
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
     1/4           cup  parsley -- chopped

Season the chicken with salt and cayenne pepper.

Heat the oil in a large dutch oven over medium high heat and sear chicken pieces on both sides until golden brown. Remove to a platter and reserve.

Add butter to pan and when melted, add flour, and stir to combine well. Continue to cook roux, stirring constantly, until chocolate brown, about 12-15 minutes.

Immediately add onion, celery, bell pepper and bay leaves and cook until soft, 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and cook another 2 minutes, then add the beer and stir well to loosen any brown bits from pan bottom. Add the stock, brown sugar, hot sauce, and worcestershire sauce and stir to combine well. Bring to a boil, return chicken pieces to the pot, and simer for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until chicken is very tender.

Remove chicken pieces to a platter and when cool enough to handle, remove meat from the bones. Return meat to etouffee and cook for another 30 minutes, until sauce is thickened and flavorful and chicken is beginning to fall aprt. Add chopped parsley and stir to combine. Adjust seasoning. Serve immediately over rice or other starch of choice.
