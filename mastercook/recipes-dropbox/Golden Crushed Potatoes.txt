  8                     yukon gold potatoes
                        cooking spray
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  salt

Preheat oven to 450.

Steam the potatoes, whole for 20 minutes, until they are still firm yet easily forked. Drain.

Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Place a potato on the tray, cut a small cross about 1/4" deep into the potato and crush the potato with the back of a wooden spoon to flatten into a patty about 1/2" thick. Try to crush so it stays together with most of the skin intact. Repeat.

Brush the tops of the potatoes with the oil, sprinkle with salt and bake until crisp and golden, about 20 minutes.
