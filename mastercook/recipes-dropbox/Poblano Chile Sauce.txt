  6                     poblano pepper
  2                     garlic clove
  1              large  onion
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chicken broth

Lay whole peppers (chiles or bell peppers) on their sides on racks of
gas stove burners (preferably 1 to a burner) and turn flame on high.
Roast peppers, turning them, until skins are blistered and have brown
patches, 3 to 6 minutes. Do not overchar bell peppers; they will lose
their bright color. (Alternatively, peppers may be roasted in same
manner on rack of a broiler pan under a preheated broiler about 2 inches
from heat.) Transfer peppers to a bowl and let stand, covered, until
cool enough to handle. Peel peppers (wear rubber gloves when handling
chiles). Cut off tops and discard seeds and ribs. Chop peppers. Peppers
may be prepared 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.


Chop garlic and chop enough onion to measure 1 cup. In a nonstick
skillet cook garlic and onion in oil over moderately low heat, stirring,
until softened. Skim fat from broth. Stir in broth and peppers and
simmer 1 minute. In a blender puree mixture until completely smooth (use
caution when blending hot liquids) and season with salt.
