--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- 1" cubes
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  1                     celery rib -- chopped
  1                     granny Smith apple -- cored and thinly sliced
     1/4      teaspoon  dried sage -- crumbled
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        salt and pepper
                        beef broth
  2                     sweet potato -- peeled and cut into large cubes

On a plate dredge cubes in flour, tapping off excess. In a large, heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over moderate heat, brown the pork on all sides, and transfer to a bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon butter in pot, add onion and celery, and stir till softened, about 5 minutes. Return pork to pot, add the apple, sage, wine, salt and pepper and enough broth to cover. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover and cook till the pork is almost tender, about 1 hour. Add the potatoes, stir, return to a simmer, and cook till tender, about 30 minutes.
