                        dark chocolate truffles
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  70% bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                   cup  cocoa powder
                        tarts
  1 1/2           cups  fine chocolate wafer crumbs (from oreos or other)
  6        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  6                     fresh raspberries

In a saucepan, bring the cream just to a simmer over low heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate in a bowl and let stand about 10 minutes to melt the chocolate. Add the vanilla and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Then beat the chocolate at medium speed until it gets thick and light colored. Spread over the bottom of a baking dish and smooth the top. Refrigrrate about 2 hours, until firm.

Pour the cocoa powder onto a deep plate or shallow bowl. Use a melon baller or small ice cream scoop to scoop out balls of chocolate; place them onn the plate with the cocoa powder and roll between 2 forks to complletely coat with the powderr. Then use forks to transfer to a parchment or waxed lined baking sheet.

Use a fork to mix together the chocolate wafer crumbs and butter. Spray the cups of a 6 muffin tin with a vegetable spray. Line the cups with strips of parchment or waxed paper, cut so they are as wide as the diameter of each cup and long enough to overhang the sides. Use the bottom of a small glass to press the crumbs over the bottoom and sides of thhe muffin ccups, building the sides up to about 1.5 inches. Place a raspberry in the middle of each crust  and wiith a pastry bag, fill the tarts with tthe truffle mixture. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours.
