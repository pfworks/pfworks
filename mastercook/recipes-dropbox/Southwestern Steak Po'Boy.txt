Split the bread in half and smear both sides with Creole mustard. In a processor puree poblano, tomatillos, onions and garlic until just incorporated. Add tomato, lime juice, and minced garlic and pulse till incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.

Pile steak on one side of bread. Top with spoonfuls of sauce. Spoon guac over that. Drizzle creme fraiche over that and top with tortilla strips. Top with other half of bread.
