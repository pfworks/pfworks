  4                     beef chuck steaks about 5 to 6 oz each
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  4             medium  yellow onion -- sliced thick
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  firmly packed dark brown sugar
  12            ounces  dark beer
  2               cups  beef broth
  1         tablespoon  dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar

Preheat oven to 300.

Season the steaks with salt and pepper. Heat oil in cast iron skillet over high heat until it shimmers. Add steaks and sear on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove and hold then on warm plate.

Add the onions to the skillet and saute until a deep, golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and saute for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the water and brown sugar and stir well.

Add beer and stir. Reduce beer to 1/2. Add broth and bring to a simmer.

Return steaks and juices to skillet and place in the oven. Braise, turning from time to time to keep moistened, until very tender, about 1.5 hours.

Remove steaks and keep warm. Place pan over medium heat and bring sauce to a simmer. Skim off fat and add mustard and vinegar. Reduce slightly over high heat and add salt and pepper. Ladle sauce over steaks and serve on heated plates.
