                        canola oil
  2             pounds  chicken wings -- separated into 2 pieces
  8             ounces  Harissa
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
                        zest and juice of 1 lemon

Heat oven to 200°. Pour oil into a 6-qt. Dutch oven to a depth of 2" and heat over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 400°. Working in two batches, add chicken wings to oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 10–12 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer wings to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to oven.

Meanwhile, put harissa, butter, zest, and juice into a medium heat-proof bowl. Set bowl over a pot of boiling water until butter is melted and sauce is hot, whisking to combine. Transfer chicken wings to the bowl and toss to combine.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  8                     dried New Mexico chiles -- stemmed and seeded
     1/2      teaspoon  caraway seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  coriander seeds
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seeds
  1           teaspoon  dried mint leaves
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  5             cloves  garlic
                        juice of 1 lemon

Put chiles into a medium bowl, cover with boiling water, and let sit until softened, about 20 minutes. Heat caraway, coriander, and cumin in an 8" skillet over medium heat. Toast spices, swirling skillet constantly, until very fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer spices to a grinder with the mint and grind to a fine powder. Set aside.

Drain chiles and transfer to the bowl of a food processor with the ground spices, olive oil, salt, garlic, and lemon juice. Purée, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl, until the paste is very smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a sterilized 1-pint glass jar and fill with oil until ingredients are submerged by 1/2". Refrigerate, topping off with more oil after each use. Harissa paste will keep for up to 3 weeks.
