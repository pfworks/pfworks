  1              pound  bacon -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  yellow onion -- peeled and chopped
  1                rib  celery -- chopped
     1/2         small  green bell pepper -- cored, seeded and chopped
  1              small  head garlic -- cloves separated, peeled and minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dry mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground white pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        finely grated zest and juice of 2 lemons
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  Asian sesame oil

For the rub: Combine brown sugar, paprika, dry mustard, garlic and onion powders, basil, bay leaves, salt, coriander, savory, thyme, black and white peppers, and cumin in a small bowl.

For the brisket: Set aside 2 tbsp of the dry rub, then rub remaining mixture all over brisket. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

For the mop: Heat stock, bay leaves, and oregano in a medium pot over medium heat. Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until fat is rendered but bacon is soft, 10-15 minutes. Transfer bacon and fat to stock. Melt butter in same skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, bell pepper, garlic, dry mustard, salt, black and white peppers, cayenne, and reserved dry tub and cook until browned, 5-7 minutes; transfer to stock. Add lemon zest and juice, soy sauce, vinegar and oils and simmer until reduced by one quarter, 30-45 minutes.

Preheat a charcoal grill. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350. Grill brisket over medium hot coals until browned on each side, 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer brisket to a large ovenproof enameled cast-iron pot or other heavy pot with a tight fitting lid. Add carrots and mop, cover, and braise in oven until tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp pointed knife, 1.5 hours. Transfer brisket to cutting board, thinly slice across the grain, then return the brisket to pot, maintaining original shape. Cover and braise in oven, basting occassionally, until very tender; 1 hour.
