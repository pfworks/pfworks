  4             ounces  bacon (about 4 slices) -- chopped
  3                     onion -- halved and sliced 1/2" thick
  4          teaspoons  brown sugar
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2                     bay leaf
  6                     7 oz bone-in blade cut pork chops, about 3/4" thick, sides slit to prevent curling
                        salt and pepper
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  fresh parsley -- minced

Cook bacon in 12 inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes; transfer to slow cooker. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat left in skillet.

Add onions, 1 teaspoon sugar, garlic and thyme to fat in skillet and cook over med-high heat until onions are softened and well browned, about 10 mintues. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in broth, scraping up any brown bits and smothing out any lumps; transfer to slow cooker.

Stir remaining tablespoon sugar, soy sauce, and bay leaves into slow cooker. Season pork with salt and pepper and nestle into slow cooker. Cover and cook until pork is tender, 6 to 8 hours on low or 3 to 5 on high.

Transfer pork chops to platter, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Let braising liquid settle for 5 mintues, them remove fat from surface. Discard bay leaves. Stir in vinegar and parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon 1 cup over chops and serve with remaining sauce.
