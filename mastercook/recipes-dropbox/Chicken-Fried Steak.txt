--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        gravy
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  unbleached flour
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
  1 1/2           cups  low-sodium chicken broth
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
                        steak
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
     1/2           cup  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
                        salt and pepper
  4              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  whole milk
  1              pound  sirloin steak tips -- trimmed and cut into 4 oz pieces
     1/4           cup  peanut or vegetable oil

Gravy: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the flour and garlic powder and cook until golden, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk in the broth, milk, salt, and pepper and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Cover and keep warm while making steak.

Steak: Whisk the flour, cornstarch, garlic and onion powders, cayenne, baking powder, 1 tspn salt and 2 tspns pepper in a large bowl. Transfer 1 cup of the mixture to a shallow dish. Beat the eggs in a second shallow dish. Add the milk to the bowl with the remaining flour mixture and rub it with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season with the salt and pepper. Score the meat lightly in a crosshatch pattern at 1/4" intervals and then dredge the meat in the seasoned flour. Pound the meat to between 1/8" and 1/4" thick. One at a time, coat the steaks lightly with the seasoned flour again, dip them in the egg, and then transfer to the bowl with the milk and flour mixture, pressing to adhere. Arrange the steaks on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate for 15 minutes or up to 4 hours; do not discard the milk and flour mixture.

Adjust an oven rack to the middle and heat the oven to 200. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over med-high heat until just smoking. Return 2 of the steaks to the bowl with the milk and flour and turn to coat. Fry the steaks until deep golden brown and crisp, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in the oven. Repeat and serve with gravy.
