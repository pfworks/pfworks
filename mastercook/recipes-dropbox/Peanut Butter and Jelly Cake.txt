--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
                        all-purpose flour
  18 1/4        ounces  white cake mix plus required ingredients
  1                cup  creamy peanut butter
  2               cups  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  milk
     3/4           cup  grape jelly

Butter a 9 inch cake pan, line with parchment, then butter again and dust with flour. Make the cake mix and fill the pan three quarters full (you'll have batter left over). Bake at 350 until done, 30-35 minutes.

Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes, then turn out on a rack and cool completely. Transfer to a work surface. Trim off the top using a serrated knofe, then slice the cake in half horizontally.

Beat the butter and peanut butter with a mixer until smooth. Alternate adding sugar and milk, beating after each addition, until the frosting is fluffy and smooth. In another bowl, whisk jelly until loose and spreadable.

Spread a thick layer of peanut butter frosting on the bottom cake half.

Spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter frosting, making sure to reach the edges. Top with other cake layer.

Cut the cake in half diagonally and transfer to serving plate.
