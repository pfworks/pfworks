  3        tablespoons  potato starch
  1         tablespoon  granulated garlic
  1         tablespoon  granulated onion
  2          teaspoons  paprika

Preheat oven to 400.

In a small bowl, combine starch, garlic, onion, paprika, pepper and sea salt. Mix well.

Rinse potatoes and scrub to remove all dirt. Do not peel. Cut each potato into 1/2" slices. Then stack the slices and cut the long way into 1/2" strips.

Place potatoes in a large bowl and sprinkle with dry ingredients. Shake bowl and toss potatoes to distribute seasonings evenly.

Lightly spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray.

Distribute potato strips in one layer on a prepared sheet and bake in preheated oven about 25 minutes. Flip the fries over and contine to bake until golden brown on the outside, soft on the inside and crunchy, about 20 more minutes.
