                        steak
  2                     red bell pepper -- stemmed, halved lengthwise and seeded
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1                     leek (white and light green parts only) -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  parsley -- chopped
                        kosher salt and black pepper
  2 1/2         pounds  flank steak -- trimmed
  8             slices  provolone cheese
                        crust
     3/4           cup  breadcrumbs
  3          teaspoons  rosemary -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  horseradish -- drained
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        kosher salt and pepper

Heat a large seasoned cast iron skillet or large frying pan over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking, about 3 minutes. Place steaks in pan and cook, undisturbed so they can get well-browned, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove steaks to a dish, top with pats of compound butter, and let rest 10 minutes before serving.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leek and garlic and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Let cool.

Gently pound the steak with the flat side of a mallet or heavy skillet until 1/4 inch thick. Lay out on a cutting board with the long side facing you and season with salt and pepper. Place the roasted peppers evenly over the meat, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Top with the cheese slices, then the leek mixture. Roll the meat away from you into a tight cylinder, tucking in the filling as you roll.

Make the crust: Mix the breadcrumbs, rosemary, parsley, horseradish, olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a medium bowl until moistened. Brush the steak roll with a bit of olive oil and press the breadcrumb mixture over the top and sides. Tie the roll with twine in three or four places, making sure it's not too tight (you want the crust to stay intact).

Place the steak roll on a rack in a roasting pan and roast until the crust is golden and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 130 degrees for medium-rare, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 15 minutes. Carefully cut off the twine, then slice the roll crosswise into 1-inch pieces.
