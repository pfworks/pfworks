--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
                        coarse sea salt
  2          teaspoons  green peppercorn
  2          teaspoons  dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon juice
  1              pinch  lemon zest
  2        tablespoons  worcestershire sauce
                        black pepper
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
  2 1/2         pounds  porterhouse steak (2) -- 2.5" thick

In a medium saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat, then add the shallots. Season with salt, and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the shallots to a medium bowl. Add the green peppercorns, mustard, lemon juice, lemon zest and worcestshire sauce. Whisk to blend. Use a fork to blend in the other 8 tablespoons of butter. Season with salt and pepper, and stir in parsley.

Roll the butter into a cylinder in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.

Heat a cast iron skillet large enough to hold steak until smoking. Blot excess moisture from steak and season with salt and pepper. Shut off heat and put steak squarely in pan with tongs. Raise the heat high and brown on the first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Lower heat and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes. Turn and brown for 3-5 minutes over high heat, then lower heat for an additional 8-10 mintues. Turn on edge with fat cap brown for 3-5 minutes on high heat, then lower for 3-5 minutes on each side. Slice the butter into 1/2" rounds and set aside. Check for doneness.

Remove steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into slices and transfer the whole thing to a heatproof platter with the meat still arranged around each side of the center bone. Top the steak with a single layer of butter slices, put it under the broiler until the butter softens, about 30-45 seconds. Serve.
