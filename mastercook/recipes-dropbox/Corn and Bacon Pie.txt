                        crust
  1                cup  unbleached flour
     3/4           cup  whole grain cornmeal -- fine-grind
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  chilled unsalted butter -- 1/2" cubes
  3        tablespoons  chilled solid vegetable shortening -- 1/2" cubes
  4        tablespoons  ice water
                        nonstick oil spray
                        filling
     1/2         pound  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  sweet onion -- chopped
  1                cup  red pepper -- chopped
  12            ounces  frozen corn kernels -- thawed and patted dry
  1 1/2           cups  half and half
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  worcestershire sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  1                cup  green onion -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  gruyere cheese -- grated and packed

Whisk first 3 ingredients for crust in a large bowl. Using back of fork, cut in butter and shortening until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add 3 tablespoons ice water. Toss until dough comes together in moist clumps, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is too dry. Shape dough into disk. Wrap; chill at least 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400. Spray 9 inch diameter glass pie dish with non-stick spray. Place parchment on work surface. Place dough in center, cover with more parchment. Roll out dough to 12 inch round. Peel off top parchment. Turn dough over into pie dish. Remove parchment. Fit crust into dish, sealing any tears. Fold excess dough under and crimp edges, forming high standing rim. Cover and chill.

Cook bacon in large skillet over medium heat until crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all but 1.5 tablespoons drippings. Add onion and pepper to skillet. Saute until almost tender, about 8 minutes. Add corn; saute until very tender, about 3 minuters longer.

Whisk next 6 ingredients in a large bowl to blend. Mix in green onions, then corn mixture. Sprinkle bacon, then cheese over botton of crust. Pour in egg mixture.

Bake pie until filling is golden and just set in center, about 55 minutes. Let pie cool at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Serve slightly warm.
