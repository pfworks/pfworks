--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  lemon juice -- freshly squozen
     1/2           cup  orange juice -- freshly squozen
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1         tablespoon  chimayo chile powder
  6             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  1              small  white onion -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/2           cup  fresh chopped herbs, such as oregano, chervil and parsley
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4              whole  chicken breast -- halved and boned, with skin

A day ahead, puree everything but the chicken in a blender. Put the chicken pieces in a glass dish, pour the herb mixture over the chicken, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight, turning occasionally. When ready to cook, drain the chicken (reserving marinade) and let stand a half hour at room temperature while you prepare smoker. Boil the reserved marinade in a small saucepan for 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then slow cook, brushing occasionally with the reserved marinade, for 45 minutes to 1 hour until cooked through.
