     1/4         pound  slab or thick cut bacon -- 1/2" pieces
  8                     skinless boneless chicken thighs (about 2.5 lbs)
                        kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
                        flour
  1         tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
  12            ounces  beer (preferably brown ale)
  1                cup  frozen pearl onion -- thawed
     1/2         pound  small red-skinned new potatoes -- halved
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar -- packed
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  3        tablespoons  fresh parsley -- chopped

Heat a large pot over med-high heat. Add the bacon and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel lined plate.

Season the chicken with salt and pepper and dredge in flour, shaking off the excess. Add the olive oil to the drippings in the pot. Add the chicken in batches and cook over med-high heat until golden on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes, then flip and sear the other side, about 1 minute.

Add the beer, onions, potatoes, mustard, sugar, thyme and 1 cup water to the pot and stir, making sure the chicken is fully submerged. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Discard the thyme and stir in the bacon and parsley.
