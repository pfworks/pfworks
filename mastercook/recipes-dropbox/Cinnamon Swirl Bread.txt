--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        dough
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3 3/4           cups  bread flour
     3/4           cup  nonfat dry milk powder
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant or rapid rise yeast
  1 1/2           cups  warm water (110 degrees)
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
                        Filling
  1                cup  powdered sugar
  3        tablespoons  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        egg wash
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten with a pinch of salt

For the Dough: Cut butter into 32 pieces and toss with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside to soften while mixing dough. Whisk remaining flour, milk powder, sugar, and yeast together in bowl of stand mixer. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, add water and egg and mix on medium-low speed until cohesive mass forms, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl if necessary. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to middle position and place loaf or cake pan on bottom of oven. Remove plastic from moxer bowl, add salt, and mix on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, 7 to 15 minutes. With mixer running, add butter, few pieces at a time, and continue to knead until butter is fully incorporated and dough is smooth and elastic and cleara sides of bowl, 3-5 minutes longer. Transfer dough to large greased bowl and, using bowl scraper or rbber spatula, fold dough over itself by gently lifting and folding edge of dough towards middle. Turn bowl 90 degrees; fold again. Turn bowl and fold dough 6 more times. Cover tightly with plastic and transfer to middle rack of oven. Pour 3 cups boiling water into loaf pan in oven, close oven door, and allow  to rise for 45 minutes.

Remove bowl from oven and gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Repeat folding step (8 folds), recover, and return to oven until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.

Filling: Whisk filling ingredients together until well combined; set aside.

Grease 2 8.5 x 4.5 loaf pans. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and divide into 2 pieces. WOrking with 1 piece of dough, pat into rough 6x11" rectangle. Roll dough away from you into ball. Dust ball with flour and flatten with rolling pin into 7x18 inch rectangle with even 1/4" thickness. Using spray bottle, spray dough lightly with water. Sprinkle half of filling evenly over dough, leaving a 1/4" border on sides and 3/4" on top and bottom; spray filling lightly with water. WIth short side facing you, roll dough away from you into firm cylinder. Turn loaf seam side up and pinch closed; pinch ends closed. Dust lightly on all sides with flour and let rest for 10 minutes. Repeat with 2nd ball of dough and filling.

Working with 1 loaf at a time, use bench scraper to cut loaf in half lengthwise; turn halves so cut sides are facing out. Gently stretch each half into 14" length. Line up pieces of dough and pinch 2 ends of strips together. Take piece on left and lay over piece on right. Repeat, keeping cut side up, until pieces of dough are tightly twisted. Pinch ends together. Transfer loaf, cut side up, to prepared loaf pan. Repeat with second loaf. Cover loaves loosely with plastic, return to oven, and allow to rise for 45 minutes. Remove loaves and water pan from oven; heat oven to 350. Allow loaves to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes longer.

Brush loaves with egg mixture. Bake until crust is well browned, about 25 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees, tent loaves with aluminum foil, and continue to bake until internal temperature registers 200 degrees, 15-25 minutes longer.

Transfer pans to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove loaves from pans, return to rack, and cool to room temperature before slicing, about 2 hours.
