                        spicy tomato sauce
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1              small  white onion -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried mexican oregano
  1                     28-oz can whole tomatoes with juice, pureed
  1                     15-oz can diced tomatoes with juice
  3        tablespoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo -- finely chopped
  1              pinch  sugar
                        kosher salt

Leaving the stem intact, carefully slit the body of each chile and remove the seeds and veins. Set aside.

Combine the orange juice, vinegar, piloncillo, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, thyme and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and continue to cook until the piloncillo has dissolved, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from the heat and add the chiles, pressing them down so they are submerged. Cover the saucepan. Soak chiles until they have reconstituted and feel fleshy, about 20 minutes.

Fry the chorizo over medium heat unti the fat is rendered and the chorizo is cooked through. Stir in the beans and mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350.

Remove chiles from liquid and transfer to paper towels to drain.

Carefully stuff chiles with the bean mixture and a strip of cheese. Close chile and bake for 15 minutes.

To serve, place 1/3 cup of the spicy tomato sauce on a large plate. Place a stuffed chile on the sauce and garnish with drizzles of creme fraiche.

Tomato Sauce: Warm the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and oregano, and saute for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes with juices and the chipotles. Season with sugar and salt to taste. Simmer uncovered until slightly thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes.
