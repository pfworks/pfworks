  1              ounce  dried porcini mushroom
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  3                     carrot -- peeled and chopped
  1                     onion -- peeled and chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded and chopped
  2             cloves  garlic
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaf -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  fresh oregano -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  5             ounces  assorted mushrooms -- stemmed and chopped
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/2           cup  red wine
     1/2           cup  marscapone cheese
  1              pound  rigatoni
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese

Place the dried mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with 1.5 cups very hot water. Set aside and let them soften.

Place the carrots, onion, bell pepper, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until finely chopped but still chunky. Place the olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add the chopped vegetables, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper and cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Strain the porcini mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Add the porcinis, fresh mushrooms, and tomato paste and continue cooking, stirring to dissolve the paste, until mushrooms are softened, about 5 minutes. Add porcini liquid and wine. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and let simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add mascarpone cheese and stir until just incorporated.

Cook pasta 8-10 minutes. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup liquid. Add pasta to sauce, adding liquid if needed. Toss with parmesan and serve.
