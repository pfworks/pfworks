  2                     poblano pepper -- chopped, stemmed and seeded
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  salt

  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  cilantro -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2             pounds  sirloin beef -- 1/2" slices
  4               long  Melissa's Sugar Cane Swizzle Stix
                        Essence
  2 1/2    tablespoons  paprika
  2        tablespoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  black pepper
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme



Combine all Essence ingredients.

Preheat the grill. In a saucepan, combine the olive oil, peppers, crushed red pepper, salt and black pepper. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce the heat. Simmer the sauce for 4 minutes and remove from the heat. Stir in the garlic. With a hand held mixer, puree until smooth. (or allow to cool slightly and puree in blender until smooth) Stir in the cilantro and kosher salt. At this point, allow the sauce to sit for 1 week under refrigeration before serving. Marinate the sliced beef in 1 cup of the sauce for 3-4 huors, refrigerated.

Remove the beef and make several slits in the beef about 1/4" apart, save the excess sauce for basting. Thread the meat through the swizzle sticks. Place on grill, cook for 2-3 minutes per side. Place remaining sauce in a saucepan and bring up to a simmer. Place skewers on platter and drizzle with sauce. Garnish with cilantro and Essence.
