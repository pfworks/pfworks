  4                     ancho or other large dried red chile
  4             pounds  beef chuck or brisket -- fat trimmed and cut into 3/4" cubes
                        salt and pepper
     1/4           cup  chile powder
  2             medium  onions -- coarsely chopped
  6                     garlic clove
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  coriander -- ground
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  mexican beer

Soak the dried chiles in boiling water to cover for at least 15 minutes.


Preheat the oven to 350. Season the meat all over with salt and pepper.
Place it into a casserole or a dutch oven. Quickly brown meat.

Drain the chiles and remove the stems and seeds. Put them into a food
processor, along with the chili powder, onions, garlic, cumin,
oregano, coriander, and salt. Pulse to chop the ingredients, and then
process to a thick paste. If the mixture gets too thick, add a little
of the beer, stock, or water. Pour in the remaining liquid and process
to blend. Add to the meat and mix well. [at this point you can marinate
overnight in the refrigerator]


Cover the casserole with foil and then put the lid on to make a tight
seal. Bake in the middle of the oven for 1
1/2 to 2 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender. Add more beer,
stock, or water to the sauce as the meat cooks if it seems to thick.


salt and pepper to taste
