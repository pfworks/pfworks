  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2               cups  corn kernels
  2               cups  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme
                        salt and pepper
     1/2           cup  white onion -- thinly sliced
  1                     tomato -- thinly sliced
  4                     poblano pepper -- charred, peeled, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1" strips
  12                    7x3" no-boil lasagna sheets
  2               cups  shredded Oaxaca or mozzarella

Preheat oven to 350.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add 2/3 of the garlic and saute for 1 minute. Mix in the corn and saute for 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and thyme. Cook over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool slightly. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small, heavy skillet over med heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add remaining garlic and cook for 1 minute. Mix in poblano strips and cook for 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.

Spread about 1/4 of corn mixture over the bottom of an 11x8 baking dish. Cover with a layer of 3 lasagna sheets. Spread 1/4 poblano mixture and 1/4 cheese. Repeat 3 more times, cover with foil.

Bake until pasta is cooked and tender, about 50 minutes. Remove the foil and broil 8-10 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes.
