  3               cups  mozzarella cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  monterey jack cheese -- grated
  1              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  vegetable oil
     2/3           cup  frank's red hot
  1                cup  panko crumbs

Preheat oven to 400. Coat bottom and sides of a 13x9 baking dish with butter.

Arrange bacon on an aluminum foil lined sheet pan and bake until crisp, about 22 minutes. Allow to cool and coarsely chop.

Put the chicken and beer in a large bowl and let marinate at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Cook macaroni until al dente. Drain and reserve in a large pot or mixing bowl.

Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; whisk in garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes. Whisk in 1/3 cup flour and cook until golden, about 1 minute. Whisk in 3 cups milk, salt and pepper, and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. Add 2 cups of cheddar and 2 cups of mozzarella and stir until melted, about 2 minutes.

Stir the cheese sauce, monterrey jack, and bacon into the macaroni until well combined; pour evenly into prepared baking dish and smooth surface.

Put the remaining 1 cup of flour in a medium-sized shallow mixing bowl. In another bowl, add the remaining 2 tablespoons milk and the egg and whisk until combined, Drain beer from chicken and dip into the flour to coat, then dip in egg mixture and back in flour. Put on a plate.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until hot. Working in 2 batches, fry chicken until golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Add the chicken and hot sauce to a large bowl and toss until well coated. Carefully slice into bite sized strips.

Evenly top macaroni with the sliced chicken and drizzle with hot sauce. Sprinkle remaining 1 cup of cheddar and mozzarella over top and sprinkle with panko crumbs. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle evenly over crumbs. Bake at 400 until golden brown and bubbly, 25-30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before serving.
