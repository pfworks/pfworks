                        chicken
  4             pounds  chicken (cut into 10 pieces, breasts halved, discard backbone and wing tips)
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  freshly ground black pepper
                        dredge
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        dip
  2              large  egg
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  vinegar based hot sauce
                        spicy sauce
  1                cup  hot frying oil
  4        tablespoons  cayenne pepper
  2        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  chile powder
                        Safflower, Vegetable, Peanut oil or Lard

Place chicken in a large bowl and rub it with the salt and black pepper; cover and let it hang out in the refrigerator for 3 hours or overnight. Let chicken stand at room temp for about 45 minutes before cooking.

Set a wire rack inside a large rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels.

Whisk flour, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt together in a 9x13x2 baking pan. Beat eggs, buttermilk and hot sauce in a medium bowl; set aside.

Heat the oil in a large skillet to about 34" deep. Heat to 350.

Dredge 1 piece chicken in the flour mixture. Shake. Dip in buttermilk mixture and sake. Dredge again in flour and shake.

Place 4-5 pieces of chicken in skillet. Working in batches, fry chicken, turning every 1-2 minutes. Maintain 325. Cook until golden brown, about 10 minutes for wings, and 17-20 for others, until they are 165.

Remove and let oil drip back into skillet. Transfer to rack and repeat until all chicken is fried.

Ladle 1 cup of hot oil into a small saucepan or heatproof bowl and whisk in cayenne pepper, dark brown sugar and chile powder. Brush or baste sauce over chicken.
