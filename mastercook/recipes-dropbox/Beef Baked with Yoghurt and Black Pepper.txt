--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             pounds  stewing beef -- 1.5" cubes
  8             ounces  onions -- very finely chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- very finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  powdered ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  2          teaspoons  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper -- coarsely ground
  10            ounces  natural yoghurt -- beaten slightly

Preheat oven to 350.

Put oil in a wide, flameproof casserole type pan and set over medium-high heat. When hot, put in as many beef chunks as the pan will hold in a single layer. Brown meat on all sides and set aside in a deep plate. Brown all the meat this way.

Put onions and garlic into the same pan and turn heat down to medium. Stir and fry for about 10 minutes or until browned. Now put in the meat and juices. Also put in ginger, cayenne, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir for a minute. Now put in the yoghurt and bring to a simmer. Cover tightly, first with foil and then with a lid. Bake in oven for 1.5 hours. If meat is not tender, add 5 oz of boiling water and cook for another 20-30 minutes. Stir before serving.
