                        chicken
  3               cups  buttermilk
  1         tablespoon  hot sauce
  3        tablespoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  dried sage -- crushed
  2          teaspoons  cayenne powder
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  1              pound  boneless skinless chicken breast -- cut into strips
  3               cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  2                     egg
  4               cups  vegetable oil
  12                    frozen belgian waffles
                        syrup
  2               cups  maple syrup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
  3 1/2    tablespoons  roasted chile oil

In a large container, combine buttermilk, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons salt, sage, 1 tspn cayenne and 1/2 tspn black pepper. Stir well and add chicken strips. Cover and refrigerate for 1-3 hours.

In a wide dish, combine flour, baking powder and the remaining salt, pepper and cayenne. Transfer chicken to flour and coat evenly. Reserve 1/2 cup of marinade.

In a medium bowl, beat eggs and reserved marinade. Dip 1 piece of chicken at a time into egg mixture and return to flour, rolling carefully to avoid separation.

In a Dutch oven over med-high heat, warm vegetable oil until 325. Add as much chicken as will fit without crowding. Fry for 6-8 minutes, carefully flip the pieces over and cook for 6-8 more minutes. Repeat and drain on paper towels.

Whisk syrup ingredients together in a small saucepan over low heat. Serve warm over chicken and waffles.
