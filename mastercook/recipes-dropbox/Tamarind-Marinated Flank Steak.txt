--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  flank steak, sirloin, skirt steak or top blade steak
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     onion -- coarsely chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- sliced
  1         tablespoon  whole mustard seeds
     1/2           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
  2        tablespoons  tamarind paste
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorns
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds
     1/2      teaspoon  cardamom seed
                        peanut oil for pan-frying
                        kosher salt and ground pepper
                        Coconut Rice

Place steak in a shallow dish.

Heat the olive oil in a pan and saute the onion over low heat until soft, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and mustard seeds, stirring until the seeds pop. Add the vinegar, molasses, tamarind paste, peppercorns, coriander and cardamom. Continue to cook until the mixture reduces enough that you can scoot it to one side of the pan without having to spread it out. Remove from heat, allow to cool, and spoon over the meat, coating both sides generously. Marinate for 1 hour on the counter or up to 24 in the refrigerator.

After the steak has marinated, scrape away any large bits of marinade and then rub with olive oil.

To grill, sear for 3-5 minutes on each side. To pan-fry, heat peanut oil until almost smoking and sear on each side for 3 minutes.

Salt and pepper the steak and tent for 5 minutes.

Slice across the grain and serve with coconut rice.
