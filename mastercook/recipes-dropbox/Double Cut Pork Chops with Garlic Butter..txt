                        pork
     1/2           cup  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorn
  1                cup  sugar
  4             sprigs  rosemary
  4                     bay leaves
  3        tablespoons  juniper berries
  1           teaspoon  juniper berries
  5        tablespoons  fennel seed
  1               head  garlic -- halved crosswise
  4                     double cut bone in rib chops (2 inches thick)
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        garlic butter
  1               head  garlic
                        extra virgin olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2          teaspoons  fresh rosemary -- chopped
     1/2                lemon (juice)
                        kosher salt

Make the brine: Combine the salt, peppercorns, sugar, rosemart sprigs, bay leaves, 3 tablespoons each juniper berries and fennel seeds, the garlic and 2 cups of water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, whisking occasionally, then remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl and add 6 cups of cold water; cool completely. Submerge chops, cover, and refrigerate overnight.

Preheat grill to medium. Cut off top 1/4 of garlic and set on a piece of foil. Drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil and place on grill. Cook about 30 minutes; let cool. Remove pork from brine and pat dry.

Squeeze cloves into a food processor. Add butter, rosemary, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pulse until smooth. Transfer to bowl.

Grind remaining 1 tspn juniper berries and 2 tablespoons fennel seeds in a spice grinder. Season pork with ground spices and salt and pepper. Lightly brush grates with oil and place pork on grill. Cover and cook until marked, 15 minutes, rotating 45 degrees halfway through. Flip and repeat, cooking until 145.

Remove from grill and spread roasted garlic butter on top. Let rest at least 10 minutes.
