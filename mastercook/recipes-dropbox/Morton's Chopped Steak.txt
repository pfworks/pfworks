     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2           cup  yellow onion -- finely diced
  2             pounds  ground sirloin
  6        tablespoons  tomato juice
     1/4           cup  red bell pepper -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  green bell pepper -- finely chopped
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten

     1/2      teaspoon  fresh ground black pepper
                        thick chili sauce

Preheat broiler and position a rack 4 inches from the element.

In a small saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat and saute the onion for 3 to 5 minutes or until tender and lightly browned. Set aside to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, use your hands to gently mix the ground beef with the tomato juice, both bell peppers, egg, salt, black pepper and cooled onions.

Shape into 4 oval patties, each about 1 inch thick.

Put the patties on a broiler pan and broil for about 7 minutes. Turn with a spatula and broil the other side for 6-8 minutes or until desired degree of doneness.

Serve with sauce.
