--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  worcestershire sauce
  1                cup  ketchup
  3        tablespoons  yellow mustard
  2          teaspoons  tabasco sauce
     1/2           cup  Dr Pepper
  1         tablespoon  chili powder
  1           teaspoon  liquid smoke flavoring
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the onion and garlic, and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining ingredients and bring the liquid to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and almost syrupy, about 45 minutes. The sauce will keep in the fridge for 2 weeks.
