--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  20            ounces  pineapple chunks in juice
     1/4           cup  packed brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  6                     7 oz bone-in blade cut pork chops, about 3/4" thick, sides slit to prevent curling
                        salt and pepper
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
  2                     scallion

Stir pineapple with juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, curry powder, ginger, and red pepper flakes into slow cooker. Season pork chops with salt and pepper and nestle into slow cooker. Cover and cook until pork is tender, 6 to 8 hours on low or 3 to 5 on high.

Transfer pork chops to serving platter, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 10 more minutes. Let braising liquid settle for 5 minutes, then remove fat from surface.

Whisk water and cornstarch together in bowl. Transfer braising liquid to saucepan, add cornstarch mixture, and simmer until reduced to 2 cups, about 12 minutes. Stir in scallions and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon 1 cup sauce over chops and serve with remaining sauce.
