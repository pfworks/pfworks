--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        vegetable oil for frying
     1/4           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  unflavored bread crumbs
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  milk
  4                     ripe but firm bananas
     1/4           cup  powdered sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Preheat oil to 365 in a deep fryer or skillet. Make sure oil is at least 3/4" deep

Place the flour and breadcrumbs on separate plates. In a medium bowl, mix egg and milk. Cut bananas diagonally into 3/4 in thick slices. Dredge individual pieces of banana in flour and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture to coat, then dredge in bread crumbs. Working in small batches, fry the bananas for 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Remove from oil with tongs and drain well. Mix together powdered sugar and cinamon, and liberally dust. Serve hot.
