--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     2/3           cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast -- 2.5 tspns
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2               cups  bread flour
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
                        pizza
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  firmly packed light brown sugar
  8             slices  thick cut applewood smoked bacon -- cut into strips
                        cornmeal
     1/4         pound  gruyere cheese -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme

To make the pizza dough, in a bowl, whisk together the water, yeast and sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, oil, 1 tspn salt, and 1/2 tspn pepper. Stir until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Pull the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead a few times, then form into a ball. Oil a second bowl, put the ball in the bowl, and turn to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm, draft-free area. Let the dough rise until doubled in size, 1-1.5 hours.

While the dough is rising, in a saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions and stir to coat. Sprinkle the sugar over the onions and stir once more. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring, until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

At the same time, in a second saute pan over medium heat, cook the bacon, stirring, until crisp, about 8 mintues. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling over medium high heat. Brush and oil the grill grate.

Dump the dough onto a floured surface, then divide in half. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out 1 half into a round 10-12 inches in diameter and about 1/8 inch thick. Repeat with the second half.

Slide 1 round onto a baker's peel or a rimless baking sheet dusted with cornmeal, and then carefully slide the round off the peel onto the grill directly over the fire. Repeat with second round. Cook the crusts unti the underside is well marked, about 2 minutes. Using the peel, transfer the crusts, grilled side up. to the work surface.

Top each crust with half the onions, half the bacon, and then half the cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Using the peel, return to grill, cover the grill, and cook until each crust is firm and browned at the edges and the cheese is melted a bit, 4-6 minutes.

Transfer pizza to cutting board and sprinkle with the thyme. Cut into wedges and serve at once.
