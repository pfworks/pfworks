--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        swirl
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/3           cup  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        cake
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  cake flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground cardamom
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  3              large  eggs
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  orange zest -- finely grated
  1                cup  buttermilk

Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325. Grease the inside of a 10" bundt pan. Dust the pan with flour.

Swirl: In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt, breaking up any lumps of brown sugar. Add the melted butter and stir until blended and crumbly.

Cake: Sift together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cardamom into a medium bowl. Whisk to combine.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, using paddle, beat the butter at medium speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the sugar and beat at med-high speed until well blended and light, about 4 minutes. At medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla and orange zest. At low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with half the buttermilk and mixing until just combined.

Scrape half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth it into an even layer. Sprinkle the streusel mixture even over the batter. Scrape the remaining batter on top and smooth.

Bake the cake for 65 to 75 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.

Invert cake on rack and cool completely.

Dust the cake lightly with powdered sugar right before serving.
