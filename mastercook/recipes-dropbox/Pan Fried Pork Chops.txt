--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne
  1                cup  unbleached flour
  4                     bone-in center cut pork chops, 3/4" thick
  3             slices  bacon -- chopped
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil

Combine garlic, paprika, salt, pepper and cayenne in a bowl. Place the flour in a shallow dish. Pat the chops dry. Cut 2 slits about 2 inches apart through the fat on the edges of each chop. Season both sides of chop with spice mixture, then dredge lightly in flour. Transfer to plate and let rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon is crisp, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels and reserve for another use. Do not wipe out the pan.

Add the oil to the fat in the pan and heat over med-high heat until just smoking. Return chops to flour dish and turn to coat. Cook the chops until well-browned, 3-4 minutes per side.
