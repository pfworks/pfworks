--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- room temperature
  2 1/3           cups  cake flour -- sifted
  2 1/2           cups  fresh blackberries
     1/4           cup  sugar
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  3              large  eggs -- room temp
  2          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  finely grated orange zest
  1                cup  well-shaken buttermilk
                        powdered sugar

Position a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350. Butter pan; line bottom with a round of parchment paper. Butter parchment. Dust with flour; tap out excess. Arrange berries in a single layer in bottom of pan; sprinkle evenly with 1/4 cup sugar.

Sift 2 1/3 cups flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda into a medium bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer, beat 3/4 cup butter and remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar in a large bowl at medium high speed, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla and zest. Reduce speed to low; beat in flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk in 2 additions, beginning and ending with flour and beating until just incorporated. Pour batter over berries in pan; smooth top.

Bake until cake is golden brown and toothpick comes out clean, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Let cool in pan set on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then run a knife around edge of pan to loosen. Remove pan sides. Invert cake onto rack and remove pan bottom; peel off parchment. Dust top generously with powdered sugar and let cool completely.
