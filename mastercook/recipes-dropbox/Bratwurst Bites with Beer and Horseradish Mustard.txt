  1 1/4         pounds  boneless country style pork spareribs, cut into 3/4" cubes
     1/3         pound  pork fat, cut into 3/4" cubes
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh sage -- finely chopped
  1 1/4      teaspoons  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  ground mace
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     3/4           cup  lager beer
                        Beer and horseradish mustard
                        pretzels or rye bread

Place ribs and fat in freezer until partially frozen, about 30 minutes. Place half of pork and half of fat in processor. Using pulse, blend mixture until finely ground. Transfer mixture to bowl. Repeat with remaining pork and fat. Gently mix sage and next 5 ingredients into ground pork. Stir in 1/4 cup beer. Cover and chill overnight.

Form pork by tablespoonfuls into 1.5 inch diamter patties; place on baking sheet.

Heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches if necessary, add sausage patties to skillet and cook until browned on bottom, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup beer to skillet; cover with lid slightly ajar and cook until beer evaporates, 6 to 7 minutes. Turn patties over and cook until brown on bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer.

Transfer to platter and serve with mustard.
