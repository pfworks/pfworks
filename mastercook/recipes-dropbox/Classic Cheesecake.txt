                        crust
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  graham cracker crumbs
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              pinch  fine salt
                        filling
  2             pounds  cream cheese -- room temp
  2               cups  sugar
  1                cup  sour cream
  6              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  1           teaspoon  lemon zest -- finely grated
  1           teaspoon  orange zest -- finely grated

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325.

Crust: Melt the butter. Brush a 9 inch springform pan with some of the butter. Stir the remaining butter together with the crumbs, sugar and salt. Press the crumb mixture over the bottom of the pan, taking care to get the crust evenly in the edges. Bake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Cool. Wrap the bottom and up the sides of the pan with foil and put in a roasting pan.

Filling: Beat the cream cheese on med speed until smooth. Add 1.25 cups sugar and beat just until light and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl and beaters as needed. Slowly beat in 3/4 cup sour cream, then eggs, 1 tablespoon vanilla and both citrus zests; take care not to over whip. Pour into cooled crust.

Bring a medium saucepan or kettle of water to a boil. Gently place the roasting pan in the oven. Pour in enough hot water to come about halfway up the side of the springform pan. Bake the cake for 1 hour and 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir together the remaining sour cream, sugar and vanilla. Spread over the top of the cooked cheesecake and return to the oven for 5 minutes. Turn the oven off, cook the cheesecake in the residual heat in the oven for 1 hour.

Remove cake from roasting pan to a rack. Run a knife around the edges and cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.

Bring cake to room temp 30 minutes before serving. Remove ring. Dip a knife in warm water, wipe dry before slicing each piece.
