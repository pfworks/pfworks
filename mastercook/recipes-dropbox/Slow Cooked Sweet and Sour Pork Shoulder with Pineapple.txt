  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  smoked hot paprika
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  7             pounds  bonless pork shoulder -- trimmed, room temp
     1/4           cup  sriracha
  2             pounds  ripe pineapple -- peeled, cored and cut into 1" pieces
  1                cup  light brown sugar
  1                cup  apple cider vinegar

In a small bowl, combine the salt, paprika and onion and garlic powders. Set pork fat side down on a work surface.Using a boning knife, cut between natural separations in meat in about 4 places. Sprinkle spice mixture all over the pork, then rub all over with sriracha sauce. Roll up and tie at 1" intervals with twine. Let marinate at room temperature for 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 325. In a roasting pan, toss the pineapple with the brown sugar and vinegar. Spread in pan and set the pork roast on top, fat side up. Roast for 4 hours, basting every 30 minutes until 165. Transfer to carving board and let rest for 20 minutes.

Set roasting pan with pineapple over high heat and boil until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove strings from pork, carve into 1/2" thick slices and arrange on a platter. Add carving juices to pan and season with salt. Serve the pork with the pineapple and pan juices.
