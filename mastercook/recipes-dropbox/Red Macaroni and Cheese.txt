--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  elbow macaroni
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  chimayo powder
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
     3/4           cup  sour cream
  2 1/4           cups  whole milk
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
    1/16           cup  monterey jack cheese -- shredded
  2              large  egg -- beaten
  1               dash  red chile hot sauce -- to taste
  1 1/4           cups  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated

Preheat the oven to 350, and butter a 3 quart glass baking dish. In a large pot, cook the macaroni in several quarts of water until just al dente. Drain the macaroni, and set aside in the buttered baking dish, covered. In a small bowl, whisk the salt, chile powder, cumin, cinnamon and nutmeg into the sour cream and set aside.

In a small saucepan, bring the milk and the cream to a simmer, and cut off the heat. In a heavy, enameled saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat and whisk in the flour. Cook the roux, whisking constantly, for 3 minutes, but do not allow to brown. Pour in the hot milk mixture, whisking constantly; reduce the heat to low and cook the sauce for 2 minutes. Stir in the seasoned sour cream mixture, the monterey jack cheese, and the eggs until well blended. Season the sauce with hot red chile sauce to taste, and pour it over the macaroni in the baking dish, stirring to mix. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with cheddar cheese and bake 25 to 30 minutes, until hot through and nicely browned on top. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
