--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2          teaspoons  chimayo powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  celery seed
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  5             pounds  pork spareribs -- trimmed
  5               cups  hickory wood chips
     1/2           cup  boubon
     1/2           cup  catsup
  2        tablespoons  ancho or pasilla puree
     1/4           cup  dark molasses
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  3 pepper or other hot pepper sauce
     1/2           cup  beer

Mix together the brown sugar, chile powder, salt, celery seed, pepper, and garlic and rub the ribs all over with the mix; chill the ribs, covered, for 3 to 4 hours. Meanwhile, soak the wood chips in cold water for 3 hours; then drain thoroughly.

In a heavy saucepan, simmer the whiskey, catsup, chile puree, molasses, soy sauce, and olive oil over moderate heat about 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning, and add salt and pepper to taste. Cool the glaze to room temperature. Prepare the grill by arranging coals around a foil drop pan placed under the center of the grill rack to catch meat juices. When the coals turn grey, spread drained hickory wood over the coals. Cut the ribs into serving pieces and arrange them in one layer on an oiled rack about 6 inches above the drip pan and close the grill lid. Cook the ribs about an hour, turning occasionally until browned but not burned. During last 15 minutes on the grill, brush the ribs with whiskey glaze. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350. When the ribs are browned, remove them to a roasting pan, pour the whiskey glaze, the beer and the pan drippings from the grill over them and bake about 30 minutes to finish cooking.
