  5             pounds  chicken wings -- separated at joints, wing tips reserved for stock
  1 3/4           cups  lime juice
  1                cup  buttermilk
  2        tablespoons  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  crushed red pepper
  1           teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Creole Seasoning
  3             quarts  vegetable oil
  1                cup  honey
  2        tablespoons  lime zest

Place the chicken in a 1 gallon re-sealable plastic food storage bag. In a medium bowl, combine 1.5 cups of the lime juice, the buttermilk, garlic, 1 tbs of red pepper and the kosher salt. Mix well to combine and pour over the chicken in the bag. Seal the bag and refrigerate overnight, or at least 12 hours, turning occasionally.

Preheat oven to 200.

Set a large, 6 quart cast-iron Dutch oven over med-high heat with 3 quarts of vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Remove chicken from refrigerator, drain through a colander, ans set aside until ready to fry.

Place the flour and Emeril's Seasoning in a 1 gallon plastic bag and place the chicken, 8 pieces at a timee, in the flour and shake to coat. Lay the coated chicken on a wire rack set over a sheet pan to rest for 20 minutes. Do all the chicken this way. Fry chicken in batches. The temperature of the oil should drop to around 300. The chicken should fry until they are golden brown and begin to float, about 7-9 minutes. Place the fried chicken on a paper-lined sheet pan and place in the overn to keep warm as you fry the rest of the chicken. Let oil return to 350 before frying new batches.

Once all the chicken is fried, place the honey, lime zest, remaining 1/4 cup of lime juice and remaining teaspoon of red pepper in a small bowl and combine. Serve wings with dipping sauce on side.
