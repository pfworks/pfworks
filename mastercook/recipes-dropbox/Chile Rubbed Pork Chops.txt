  2              large  onion
     1/3           cup  new mexico chile powder
                        kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  ground clove
  2             cloves  garlic -- smashed
  8                     thin cut boneless pork chops (about 2 lbs) -- trimmed

Roughly chop 1/2 onion and place in a blender with the chile powder, 1.5 tspns salt, oregano, cumin, cloves and garlic. Puree, adding about 1/3 cup water to make a thick paste.

Slice the remaining 1.5 onions into thin rings and place in a bowl with the chile puree and pork. Toss to coat.

Lightly brush a large cast-iron skillet or grill pan with vegetable oil and place over high heat until almost smoking. Place 4 chops in the skillet and surround with 1/2 of the onions. Cook until the pork starts to blacken on the outside and is cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Repeat. Serve with spanish rice, if desired.
