                        Basic Pizza Dough
     1/2         pound  hot italian sausage -- casing removed and crumbled
  1                cup  yellow onions -- sliced
     1/2           cup  red bell pepper -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  green bell pepper -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  jalepeno -- thinly sliced and seeded and stemmed
  2        tablespoons  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  italian seasoning
     1/2         pound  sliced ham
     1/4         pound  thinly sliced pepperoni
  2               cups  provolone cheese -- grated
  2               cups  mozzarella cheese -- grated
  1              large  egg -- beaten with 1 tbspn water
  1                cup  parmesan cheese -- finely grated

Preheat oven to 375. Grease a large baking sheet and set aside.



In a large skillet, cook the sausage over med-high heat until browned and the fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain well on paper towels. Discard all but 1 tbspn fat from the pan. Add the onions, bell peppers, and jalapenos and cook, stirring, until very soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and cool.

Punch down the dough and divide in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out half of the dough to a large rectangle, about 10x14 inches. Spread half the cooled sausage mixture across the dough leaving a 1 inch border. Overlapping slightly, layer half the ham, pepperoni, provolone and mozzarella cheese over the top. Using a pstry brush, paint the border of 1 long edge with egg wash. Starting at the opposite long end w/o wash, roll up the dough into a cylinder, pinching the edges to seal. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat. Let the dough rise, 20 to 30 minutes.

Brush the top of each with egg wash. Bake until nearly completely golden brown and starting to crisp, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle each stromboli with parmesan cheese and return to the oven until cheese is melted and dough is golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Remove from oven and let stand 10 minutes before serving.
