--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small red potatoes
     1/3           cup  tomato based bbq sauce
  1              pound  applewood or hickory smoked thick cut bacon
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
                        salt and pepper
  1             medium  sweet onion -- quartered and thinly sliced
  8             ounces  cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  skim milk
  2        tablespoons  cilantro and chives -- chopped

Preheat oven or grill to 400.

Wash potatoes and slice about 1/4" thick. Toss in BBQ sauce and marinate for about an hour.

In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until almost crispy. Transfer all but 1 slice to a paper towel lined plate to cool. Fry remaining strip until crispy and add to plate. When cool, chop less crispy bacon into small bits and reserve crispy strip.

Use bacon grease to coat a deep 9x13 ovenproof glass or ceramic casserole dish. Cover the bottom with half the potatoes. Sprinkle with half the cumin, then season with salt and pepper. Add a layer of onions, then the chopped bacon, and half the cheese. Add the rest of the potatoes, sprinkle with the rest of the cumin, and add salt and pepper. Level with a spatula, then pour milk over top.

Cover and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove cover and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake for another 20 minutes. Garnish with bacon, chives and cilantro.
