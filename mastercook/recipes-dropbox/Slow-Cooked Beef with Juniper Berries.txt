--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  yellow onion -- thinly sliced crosswise
  2             pounds  beef chuck -- cut into 2-3 pieces
  1           teaspoon  juniper berrries
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper

Put the olive oil and onion in a heavy braising pot and place the meat on top. Lightly crush the juniper berries by wrapping them in a paper towel and mashing them with a meat pounder and add them to the pot. Add the vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Wrap the lid with a wet cloth towel or a triple layer of wet paper towels and cover the pot tightly with it. Turn the heat under the pot to med-low.

When you hear the contents of the ppot bubbling, remove the lid and adjust the heat so that the meat cooks at a very gentle simmer. Replace the lid and simmer until the meat is extremely tender when prodded with a fork, about 2 hours. You can begin checking it after 1 hour. If all the liquid evaporates before the meat is tender, add a little water. WHen the meat is done, the sauce should be thick enough to cling to a spoon. If it is too thin, remove the meat and raise the heat till reduced.

Slice meat, return it to the pot to cot with the sauce, and serve.
