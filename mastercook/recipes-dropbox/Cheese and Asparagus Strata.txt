  12                    thin asparagus spears
  1              pound  texas Toast
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  12                    thin slices prosciutto or ham
  1                cup  cheddar cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
  6              large  eggs
  3               cups  milk
  1         tablespoon  dehydrated onion flakes
  2          teaspoons  chipotle powder

Cut off tough ends of asparagus and then lay in a large, non-stick skillet. Cover with water and cook over medium heat until tender but still crisp. Drain and let cool.

Spray a 13x9 inch glass Pyrex baking dish with cooking spray. Brush one side of 6 slices of bread with the melted butter and place the slices in the baking dish, butter side down. Wrap each cooled spear with prosciutto and place on top of bread.

Mix cheddar and parmesan together and sprinkle half of the mixture on top. Brush remaining 6 slices of bread and place butter side up on top.

Lightly beat eggs and then whisk in milk. Stir in onion flakes and chipotle powder and pour over bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

About an hour before serving, preheat oven to 325. Take strata out of fridge and remove plastic wrap. Bake for 45 minutes, remove from oven, and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Return to oven and bake until hot and bubbly.
