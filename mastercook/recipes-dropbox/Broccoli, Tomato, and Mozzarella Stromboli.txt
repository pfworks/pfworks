  1              pound  pizza dough
                        flour
  1              pound  frozen chopped broccoli
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
                        coarse salt and pepper
  1                cup  marinara sauce
  1 1/2           cups  part-skim mozzarella -- shredded
  2             ounces  thinly sliced Genoa salami -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Preheat oven to 400. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Divide dough into 4 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, stretch out each piece into a 3x4" oval, then to a 6x8" oval.

Place broccoli in a strainer, and press to remove excess liquid. Transfer to paper towels and and pat dry.

Scatter broccoli evenly over dough, leaving a 1/2" border. Sprinkle with garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Top with mozzarella, salami, and 1/2 cup marinara.

Starting at a shorter end, roll up each stromboli, and place, seam side down, on baking sheet. Using tip of paring knife, cut two slits in the top of each. Brush with oil. Bake until golden, 25-30 minutes. Serve with 1/2 cup marinara for dipping.
