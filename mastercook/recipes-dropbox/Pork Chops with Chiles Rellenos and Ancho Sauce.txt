  6              large  fresh poblano chiles -- stemmed
  1           teaspoon  cumin seeds
  12            ounces  unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes -- 1/3" cubes
  1 1/4           cups  sharp white cheddar cheese -- grated
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano -- chopped
  1                cup  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  orange juice
  5          teaspoons  ancho chile powder
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  Italian double-concentrated tomato paste
  1                     cinnamon stick
  1              clove  garlic -- pressed
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  6                     1 inch thick pork loin chops on bone -- frenched
                        olive oil

Char chiles over gas flame or in broiler until blackened all over. Place chiles in bowl; cover tightly with plastic wrap and steam for 15 minutes. Peel, leaving stem intact, do not tear chiles. Using small, sharp knife, cut 1 long slit down side of each chile; carefully remove seeds. Toast cumin seeds in small skillet over med-high heat until darkened and armotic, 1 to 2 minutes. Set chiles and cumin aside.

Line rimless baking sheet with foil. Cook potatoes in large saucepan of boiling salted water until just tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Transfer potatoes to medium bowl; cool. Add cheese, chopped oregano, and toasted cumin; stir to distribute evenly. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Carefully fill chiles with potato mixture, about 1/3 to 1/2 cup for each. Working with 1 chile at a time, hold in palm and squeeze gently to compress. Place stuffed chiles on prepared sheet.

Combine broth, juice, 2 tspns chile powder and next 4 ingredients in heavy medium saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened and reduced to 2/3 cup, 8 to 9 minutes.

Mix 3 teaspoons chile powder and 1 tablespoon salt in small bowl. Sprinkle mixture over pork chops; let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.

Brush pork with oil. Place pork chops on 1 side of grill. Transfer chiles on foil to opposite side of grill. Grill chops until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side; transfer to plate and let rest 10 minutes. Grill chiles until cheese melts, about 15 minutes.

Rewarm sauce. Place 1 pork chop and 1 chile on each plate. Drizzle sauce over, sprinkle with oregano leaves, and serve.
