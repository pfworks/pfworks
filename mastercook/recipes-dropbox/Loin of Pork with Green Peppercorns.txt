  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4          teaspoons  dijon mustard
  4          teaspoons  whole grain mustard
  1           teaspoon  ground fennel seed
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour

  3               cups  chicken stock
     1/4           cup  green peppercorns in brine -- drained

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Allow the pork to stand at room temp for 30 minutes.

Place the pork, fat side up, in a roasting pan just large enough to hold it comfortably. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 2 rspns of each mustard, the fennel seed, 2 tspns of salt, and 1/2 tspn black pepper. Rub the mixture on top of the pork and roast for 1 to 1.25 hours, until 140. Remove from oven, trnasfer to cutting board, and cover tightly with foil for 20 minutes.

For the sauce, remove all but 1/4 cup fat from pan. If there is not 1/4 cup, add butter. Over med heat, whisk the flour into the pan and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the stock, the remaining 2 tspns of each mustard, the green peppercorns, 2 tspns salt, and 1/2 tspn black pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sauce is rediced and slightly thickened.

Remove strings from pork, slice between the bones, and serve warm with the hot sauce.
