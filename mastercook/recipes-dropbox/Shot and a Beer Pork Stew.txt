  2                     dried chipotle chiles
  2                     dried ancho pepper
  12            ounces  mexican lager such as tecate
     1/4           cup  white tequila
  3 1/2         pounds  pork shoulder -- 2 inch cubes
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  mexican oregano
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin

Preheat oven to 350. Wipe chiles clean with a damp cloth. Toast chiles in saucepan over med-heat until fragrant and puffy, 3-5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then remove stem, seeds and membrane. Pour beer and tequila over chiles to soften.

Meanwhile, season pork with salt. Heat oil in a heavy, large ovenproof pot over medium-high heat. Brown half the pork at a time, 8-10 minutes per batch. Transfer pork to a bowl.

Add onion and garlic to pot; cook until soft, stirring often, 5 minutes. Stir in beer mixture, tomatoes, oregano, cumin and pork. Add water if needed to barely cover. Bring to a boil over high heat; cover.

Bake stew until pork is falling apart tender, about 3 hours. Skim fat and serve.
