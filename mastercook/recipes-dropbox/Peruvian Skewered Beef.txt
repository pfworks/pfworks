  1           teaspoon  fresh garlic -- minced
     1/3           cup  red wine vinegar
     2/3           cup  salad oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  chile pequin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper -- freshly ground
  2                     bay leaf
  1              pound  top sirloin -- fat removed, cut into 1/2" cubes

In a medium bowl place all of the ingredients (except for the bay leaf and the beef). Whisk them together well. Add the bay leaves and the beef, and toss them in so that the beef is well coated with the marinade. Refrigerate the beef for 12 hours.

Place the beef on skewers. Grill for 3-4 minutes or until done.
