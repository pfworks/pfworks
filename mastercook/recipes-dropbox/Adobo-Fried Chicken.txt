  1           teaspoon  salt
                        chicken
  2             pounds  chicken pieces with skin and bones
                        salt
  2               cups  buttermilk
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
  8               cups  peanut oil

Make the sauce. Combine sauce with 3/4 cup water and refrigerate.

Make the broth. In a large pot with a tight lid, combine all of the ingredients with 1.5 cups water, or enough to cover chicken. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes, then turn down as low as possible.

Arrange chicken and season with salt. Add to broth, cover and poach for 15 minutes, turning once halfway through. Keep lower than gentle simmer.

Turn off heat and allow chicken to soak for 20 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels and discard broth.

Pour buttermilk in a large shallow bowl. In a plastic bag, combine flour, 1 tspn salt, paprika and the pepper. Dip chicken in buttermilk then shake in bag. Let chicken rest for 15 minutes.

Heat oil to 365. Cook chicken in batches for 8-10 minutes, turning every minute. Keep oil between 350 and 365. Chicken should be 165.

Let chicken cool and serve with sauce.
