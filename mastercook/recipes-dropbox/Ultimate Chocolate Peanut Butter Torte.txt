--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  butter -- melted
  1                cup  unsweetened cocoa
  2               cups  sugar
  4                     egg
  4          teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  chopped peanut butter cups (about 8 pieces)
     1/4           cup  peanut butter -- heated for spreading
  2        tablespoons  peanut butter
     1/4           cup  confectioner's sugar
     1/2           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  chocolate chip

Preheat oven to 350. Butter 2 8 inch circular pans and line with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl combine the 1 cup melted butter and cocoa and stir until dissolved.

Add the sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, and mix well. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until incorporated. Stir in the vanilla, flour and salt until flour is no longer visible. Fold in the chopped peanut butter cups and divide the mixure between the pans. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

Run a knife around the edge of each pan and turn out onto a work surface.

Put 1 cake layer on a cake plate or round platter. Spread the 1/4 cup of peanut butter over the first layer and top with second layer. In a bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, the confectioner's sugar and water until a glaze forms. Add more water, if needed, to achieve desired glaze consistency. Pour the glaze on top of the torte, spreading with a small knife allowing it to drip over the sides. Melt chocolate chips in a double boiler and drizzle over glaze. Cut into slices and serve.
