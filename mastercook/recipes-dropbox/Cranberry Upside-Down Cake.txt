                        topping
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  9             ounces  fresh cranberries -- 2 2/3 cups
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
                        batter
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  butter -- room temp
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2                     egg -- separated
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar

Preheat oven to 350. To prepare topping, put butter and brown sugar in a 9 inch round cake pan, and put it in the oven. As the sugar dissolves, stir to distribute the mixture evenly over the pan. When the sugar starts to carmelize, remove pan and allow to cool.

In a small bowl, combine cranberries and orange juice. Toss to coat berries. Spread berries evenly in pan and sprinkle with remaining juice in bowl. Set pan aside.

Sift together flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl.

Cream butter until pale, light and fluffy. Add vanilla, and beat in egg yolks one at a time, scraping down bowl. Add flour mixture alternatel with milk, ending with dry ingredients.

Whisk egg whites with cream of tartar just until whites are stiff enough to hold a slight peak. Fold whites into batter 1/3 at a time. Spoon batter into pan, and spread evenly over cranberries. Bake until top is browned and cake puls away slightly, 25-35 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Turn out. Serve with whipped cream flavored with orange liquer.
