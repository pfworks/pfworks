                        Chile Marinade
  1         tablespoon  ancho chile -- ground
  2        tablespoons  Chimayo chile -- ground
  2        tablespoons  white onion -- minced
  3          teaspoons  garlic -- minced
     1/3           cup  cilantro -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  cumin seed -- ground
     1/3           cup  lime or lemon juice -- freshly squeezed
     1/3           cup  fruity olive oil
                        salt
                        pork loin
  2             pounds  bonless pork loin -- 1/2" slices
                        roasted pineapple salsa
  1             medium  pineapple -- peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
     1/2           cup  red onion -- minced
  1                cup  cilantro -- chopped
  1                     jalapeno chile pepper -- seeded and minced
  2        tablespoons  rice wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
                        salt

Mix all marinade ingredients in small bowl and reserve.

Place sliced pork loin in a large plastic bag. Add the marinade and coat the meat thouroughly. Seal the bag and refrigerate for 1 hour at room temperature or 4 hours refrigerated. Return pork to room temp before cooking.

Grill pineapple slices until lightly browned on both sides.

Cool, remove pineapple cores, and dice.

Combine all ingredients and season to taste with salt. Cover and allow to sit at room temp for 1 hour. The salsa is best if mixed 1 hour before serving. However, the ingredients can be prepared several hours in advance and prepared just prior to serving.

Preheat a grill or broiler. Lightly brush the grill rack with vegetable oil.

Remove slices of pork loin from the marinade, brushing off the excess marinade by hand. Grill the slices on each side until cooked through but still juice inside, about 3-4 minutes per side.

To serve, top the grilled pork loin slices with several spoonfuls of pineapple salsa.
