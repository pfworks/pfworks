--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  onion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  garlic -- minced
     3/4           cup  carne seca -- diced or cut into strips
  2               cups  plum tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2           cup  cilantro -- chopped
  8               cups  beef broth
  1                cup  potato -- med-diced
     1/2           cup  carrots -- med-diced
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper

Heat a soup pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When shimmering, add the onion and saute, stirring occasionally, until it is tender and a deep golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 to 40 seconds.

Add the beef, tomatoes and cilantro, stir well to coat, and saute for 3 more minutes. Add the broth, potatoes and carrots and bring the soup to a boil, skimming the surface, as needed. Reduce heat slightly, and simmer until the carrots are tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
