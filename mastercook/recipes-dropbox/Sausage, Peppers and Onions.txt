  4                     italian sausage link
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     green bell pepper -- 2-3" long strips
  1                     red bell pepper -- 2-3" long strips
  1                     yellow or orange bell pepper -- 2-3" long strips
  4             cloves  garlic -- sliced into slivers
  1              large  sweet onion -- 1/4" moons
  15            ounces  crushed tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  red or marsala wine
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        salt

Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pan that has a lid. When oil is hot, add sausages and brown them slowly. If they sizzle and crackle too much, turn heat down. You want a gentle browing, not a sear.. Cook for several minutes, until evenly browned. Remove from pan and set aside.

Increase heat to high and add onions and peppers. Toss to coat and sear them, stirring often. You want some blackening. Once the onions and peppers soften, sprinkle some salt on them. Once there is some searing, add garlic and cook for another minute.

Add the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan. Let the wine reduce by half.

Add tomatoes, oregano and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. Add sausages back in. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to low.Cover and simmer until peppers are soft and sausages are cooked, about 20 minutes.
