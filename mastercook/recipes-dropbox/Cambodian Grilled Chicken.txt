                        chicken and marinade
  1              whole  chicken (3-4 lbs)
  5             cloves  garlic -- peeled and halved
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  asian fish sauce (or more soy)
                        glaze
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              clove  garlic -- peeled and gently crushed
  2          teaspoons  annatto seeds, or 2 tspns sweet paprika
                        dipping sauce
  1           teaspoon  coarse salt
  1           teaspoon  finely ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
  2                     limes

Prepare the chicken and marinade: Remove and discard the fat just inside the neck and body cavities of the chicken. Remove the package of giblets and set it aside for another use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot it dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Spatchcock the chicken. Make 2 deep slashes to the bone in both sides of the chicken breast and in each leg and thigh. Trim or fold the wing tips back behind the wings. Place the bird in a non reactive baking dish just large enough to hold it.

Place the garlic halves, sugar, and salt in a heavy mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. If you do not have a mortar and pestle, combine the garlick, sugar and salt in a small food processor and puree to a paste, then work in the soy and fish sauce. Spoon the marinade over the chicken, forcing it into the slits and turning the bird to coat it well on both sides. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 to 4 hours.

Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small heatproof bowl. Add the annatto seeds to the saucepan with the oil and cook until fragrant and browned and the oil turns orange, about 2 minutes. If you are using paprika instead of seeds, cook for only 15 seconds. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh wire strainer into the bowl with garlic. Set the glaze aside.

Prepare the dipping sauce: Place 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and 1/4 tspn of sugar, if using, in 2 small attractive bowls. Have the limes ready; you'll add the lime juice at the last minute.

Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to medium. Leave one section bare for a safety zone.

When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade and arrange it on the hot grate or in an oiled basket, skin side down. Grill until golden and cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes per side. Move the chicken as needed to dodge flare-ups. Internal temp should be about 170. During last 10 minutes of cooking, start brushing both sides of chicken with glaze.

To server, transfer chicken to a platte, skin side up. Let it rest for about 2 minutes, then cut it into pieces with a cleaver. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to each bowl with the salt, pepper and sugar for the dipping sauce and stir till sugar dissolves. To eat, dip the pieces of chicken in the salted lime juice.
