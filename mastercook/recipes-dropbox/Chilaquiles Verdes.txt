                        salsa verde
  8             medium  tomatillo -- husked and rinsed
  1                     serrano pepper
     1/2                white onion -- halved
  2             cloves  garlic
     1/2                bay leaf
  1              pinch  oregano
  1              pinch  thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  low-sodium chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  corn oil
			
                        vegetable oil
  12                    6 inch corn tortillas
  2              large  eggs -- beaten
     1/2           cup  monterey jack cheese -- shredded
  2        tablespoons  queso fresco
  3        tablespoons  white onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  cilantro -- finely chopped
                        crema fresca or sour cream

Put the tomatillos, chile, onion and garlic in a medium pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to med-low and simmer until the vegetables are soft and the tomatillos turn pale green, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

Carefully transfer the boiled vegetables, along with the cooking water, to a blender. Puree for a few seconds to blend; be sure to hold down the lid with a towel for safety. Add the 1/2 bay leaf, oregano, thyme, salt and broth. Continue to puree until smooth.

Place a wide pot over medium high heat and coat with corn oil. When the oil is hazy, pour in the salsa verde; it will bubble a bit. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to very low, and keep warm.

Pour vegetable oil in a heavy pot or fryer to a depth of about 2 inches and heat to 375. Stack the tortillas and fan them to separate. Cut into 8 wedges.

Fry the chips in batches until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Remove to paper towel lined baking pan to cool and drain.

Uncover salsa verde and raise heat to medium. Just when it start to bubble, stir in the beaten eggs. Cook and stir for about 5 seconds. Immediately add the chips, tossing gently until they start to become soft. Sprinkle jack cheese on top and let melt.

Divide up among plates and sprinkle with queso fresco, chopped onion, and cilantro. Garnish with crema fresca and serve.
