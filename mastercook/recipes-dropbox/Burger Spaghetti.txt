Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the meatballs and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake until just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Reserve skillet.

Cook pasta. Add garlic to skillet; cook over medium heat until golden, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and 2 tablespoons kethcup; cook 1 minute, then stir in 1 cup pasta water until smooth. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Drain pasta, add to the skillet and toss to coat. Divide pasta among bowls and top with toasted breadcrumbs, meatballs, grated cheddar, lettuce, tomato and pickle slices.
