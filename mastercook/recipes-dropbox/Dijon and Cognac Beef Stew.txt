Add carrots, then continue to simmer for 30 minutes, or until slices are tender. As they cook, heat 2 tablespoons butter in medium skillet over med-high heat, and saute mushrooms until browned and tender.

Stir mushrooms into stew along with remaining mustard and red wine. Simmer 5 minutes, adjust seasonings and serve.
