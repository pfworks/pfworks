--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  cold water
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  coarse salt
  2               each  bay leaf
  1         tablespoon  black peppercorn -- whole
  1         tablespoon  allspice berries
  3             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  1 3/4         pounds  pork loin -- cut 1.5" cubes
     1/2                pineapple -- peeled, cored and cut into 1" chunks
  16            medium  jalepenos -- cut in half lengthwise
                        spicy molasses glaze
  1           teaspoon  black pepper
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil

Combine water, sugar salt, bay leaves, peppercorns, allspice and garlic in a bowl. Add pork, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Drain and set aside.

Thread 4 cubes of pork, alternating with pineapple chunks and pepper halves, onto 8 skewers. Brush with glaze and season with salt and pepper.

Arrange skewers, off direct heat, on a hot grill. Grill, rotating skewers and brushing with remaining glaze and olive oil to prevent sticking as neccessary, until pork is cooked through but juicy in the center, about 12 minutes. Pineapples and peppers should be soft but charred.
