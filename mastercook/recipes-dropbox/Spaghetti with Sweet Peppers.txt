--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red onion -- thinly sliced
  5                     red bell pepper -- 1/2 inch strips
  5                     orange bell pepper -- 1/2 inch strips
  1         tablespoon  red chile flakes
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
  1                can  tomato paste
  1                cup  dry red wine
  1                 ln  spaghetti

In a 12-14 inch frying pan, heat oil over medium heat until smoking. Add the onions, peppers, chile flakes and oregano and cook 8 to 10 minutes, until softened. Add the tomato paste and cook 15 to 18 minutes, until paste turns a darker color. Add the red wine, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes, augmenting the pan with water, 1/4 cup at a time to keep the liquidity near that of a ragu.

Cook pasta 1 minute short of al dente. Drain and toss in pepper mixture and place pan over high heat. Cook for about 45 seconds.
