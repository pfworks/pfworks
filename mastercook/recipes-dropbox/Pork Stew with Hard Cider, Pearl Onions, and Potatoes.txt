                        kosher salt

  1                cup  parsnip -- finely chopped
  6          teaspoons  fresh sage -- chopped
     1/2           cup  calvados (apple brandy)
  1         tablespoon  calvados
  2               cups  chicken broth
  12            ounces  hard apple cider
  1 1/2         pounds  unpeeled baby red potatoes (2" diam) -- scrubbed and halved
  2              large  granny smith apples -- peeled, cored, cut into 1" cubes
  2        tablespoons  butter -- room temp
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  whole grain dijon mustard

Cook onions in large saucepan of boiling salted water 2 minutes; transfer to bowl of ice water to cool. Peel onions, set aside.

Cook bacon in heavy large pot over medium heat until lightly browned. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towels to drain. Sprinkle pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Increase heat to med-high. Working in 2 batches, add pork to same pot and cook until browned, about 7 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to large bowl. Reduce heat to medium; add shallots and parsnips. Cover pot and cook until beginning to soften, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 tspns sage; stir 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup Calvados; cook until almost evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add broth, cider, reserved bacon, and pork with any juices. Bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits with wooden spoon. Reduce heat to med-low; cover and simmer until pork is tender, about 1 hr 15 minutes.

Add potatoes and pearl onions to stew; cover and cook until vegetables are almost tender, about 30 minutes. Add apples, cover and cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Spoon fat from surface of juices, if necessary. Stir butter and flour in small bowl to form paste; add to pot and whisk to blend. Stir in mustard, 2 tspns sage, and 1 tbspn calvados. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until thickened, stirring often, 2 to 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Server and sprinkle with remaining 1 tspn sage.
