  1             medium  red onion -- peeled, halved and thinly sliced
                        burgers
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef
                        kosher salt and pepper
  4                     hamburger buns -- split and lightly toasted
  12                    blue or yellow corn tortilla chips -- coarsely crushed

Queso sauce: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the milk, increase the heat to high and cook, whisking, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the cheese unti melted; add the Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Relish: Combine all ingredients and season with salt and pepper.

Onions: Bring vinegar, water, sugar and salt to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Put the onions in a medium bowl, pour the vinegar over, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48.

Burgers: Heat a griddle or large saute pan over high heat. Add the oil and let it heat until it begins to shimmer. Shape the beef into 4 round patties about 1.5 inches thick and season each burger on both sides with salt and pepper. Cook until medium.

Put the burgers on the buns and top each with a few tablespoons of the queso sauce, relish, onions and chips.
