--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  8        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  hot water
  3                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1              pinch  salt

In a saucepan, stir together cornstarch, 2 tablespoons sugar, and enough of the hot water to make a smooth paste. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and clear. Set aside to cool.

Combine the egg whites and salt in a chilled bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add the cooled cornstarch mixture, and then the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat until the whites form stiff peaks but aren't dry.
