                        Horseradish creme fraiche
  1                cup  horseradish root -- peeled and finely grated
  8             ounces  creme fraiche or sour cream
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
                        coarse kosher salt
                        Onion Jam
  1 1/2         pounds  red onions -- very thinly sliced
  2               cups  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar
                        tacos
  10                    7-8 inch diameter flour tortillas -- cut into 5" square
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4                     9-10 oz boneless rib eye steaks -- excess fat trimmed
                        fresh cilantro sprigs

For horseradish creme fraiche: Mix first 3 ingredients in a small bowl to blend. Season to taste with salt. Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.

For onion jam: Combine onions, wine, honey, and thyme in large skillet. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered until wine is almost absorbed, stirring occasionally, about 55 minutes. Mix in red wine vinegar. Simmer 10 minutes to blend flavors, adding water by tablespoonfuls to moisten if jam is dry and stirring often (onions will still be slightly crunchy). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Before using, rewarm over medium heat until just warm, adding more water by tablespoonfuls if jam is dry.

For tacos: Preheat oven to 350. Wrap tortillas in foil, enclosing completely. Place in oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespon of olive oil in each of 2 heavy large skillets over high heat. Add 2 steaks to each skillet and cook to desired doneness, about 3 minutes per side for medium rare. Transfer steak to cutting board. Thinly slice steaks crosswise. Divide steak slices among warm tortillas. Top with onion jam, then a spoonful or creme fraiche. Garnish with cilantro sprigs.
