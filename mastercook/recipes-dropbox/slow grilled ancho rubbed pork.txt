For the rub:  Toast the ancho chile pieces over low heat in a dry skillet until fragrant, shaking the pan so they don't scorch. Put the chiles in spice grinder and pulse into a powder. Add the remaining ingredients and buzz  again.

Rub the spice mix into the pork and set aside for 1 hour. Light the coals in a bbq with a cover. When the coals are hot, push them to 1 side of the grill. Rub the pork with some olive oil and season it liberally with salt. Put the pork on the grill away from the coals and place a drop pan under the meat. Close the cover and cook, maintaining a low temperature, for about 4 to 6 hours, or until the meat shreds easily. Turn the meat occassionally and baste with drippings.

For the sauce: Combine all ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. Season to tast. Drizle over shredded pork.
