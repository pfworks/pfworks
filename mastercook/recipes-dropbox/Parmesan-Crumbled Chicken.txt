--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
  6        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  white wine
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  1                cup  Parmigiano Reggiano -- freshly grated
  1                cup  fresh english muffin or bread crumbs
  4        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter

Rinse the breasts and pat them dry. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the mustard, wine, 3/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper and add the chicken. The chicken can be coated immediatley or refrigerated for 2 hours.

In a large, shallow dish, mix the cheese, breadcrumbs and a few grinds of pepper. Drizzle the melted butter over mixture and toss until well combined.

Heat oven to 450 and butter a baking sheet or rack. Take a breast from the marinade with one hand. Lay chicken on the crumbs. Scoop and pat crumbs over the breast with the other hand, patting until both sides are coated. Put on baking sheet.

Roast chicken until it's crisp, browned and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. Check after 15 minutes. If it's too brown, reduce heat to 400 and add 5 minutes to cooking time.
