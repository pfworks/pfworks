  1           teaspoon  sea salt
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  2             pounds  chicken wings
  4             cloves  garlic
  1                 in  ginger
     1/4           cup  korean chile paste (gochujang)
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  rice wine vinegar
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  asian fish sauce
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil

Place wire rack inside of a rimmed baking sheet. Place the egg whites, baking soda and sea salt in a large bowl and beat until the salt and baking soda is dissolved into the egg whites. Toss the chicken in the mixture, making sure to coat all side of the wings. Pick wings up from bowl, allowing excess to drip, and put on the wire rack, making sure the wings aren't touching. Put in the refrigerator, uncovered for 8 hours or overnight to dry out. Flip winfs once.

Preheat oven to 450. Place the wings in the rack in the oven for 15 minutes, then flip the wings over and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Flip once more and bake for 10 more minutes, until crispy and golden brown. Remove and let rest 5 minutes.

Whule chicken is baking, prepare the sauce by mincing. Peel, then grate ginger. Place the garlic and ginger in a large saure pan or wok and add the remaining ingredients. Once wings are out of oven, turn heat to medium and cook the sauce until it thickens slightly, 2-3 minutes. Toss wings in sauce and serve.
