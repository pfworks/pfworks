  2        tablespoons  milk
  4                     egg white
     3/4           cup  butter
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
  2               cups  flour
  2        tablespoons  flour
  3          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
                        frosting
     1/2           cup  butter
  3               cups  powdered sugar -- sifted
  1           teaspoon  minced lemon peel rehydrated in 1 tb water
     1/2      teaspoon  pure lemon extract
     1/2      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  milk

Two hours before baking cake, combine poppy seeds and milk in a bowl and let soak. Preheat oven to 375. Grease a 9x13 pan and set aside. Beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff and set aside. In a mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Alternate adding the dry mixture and poppy seed mixture to the butter mixture, blending well after each addition. Add vanilla and mix well. Gently fold in egg whites by hand. Pour into pan and bake at 375 for 10 minutes. Reduce to 350 and bake another 15-20 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Cool before frosting.

Beat together all frosting ingredients except milk. Add enough milk to desired consistency and beat well.
