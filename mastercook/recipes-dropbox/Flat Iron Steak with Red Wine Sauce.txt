  2                     1 lb flat iron or tri tip steaks
                        salt and freshly ground pepper
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4           cup  tomato paste
  2 1/2           cups  dry red wine

Prepare the grill for med-high heat. Sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper and drizzle with the 3 tbspns of olive oil. Grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for med-rare. Transfer to cutting board and tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt 2 tbspns butter in a heavy large saucepan over med-high heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. Add the garlic and oregano and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Whisk in the wine. Simmer until the sauce reduces by half, stirring occassionally, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. Strain the sauce into a small bowl, pressing to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids and return sauce to saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Cut remaining butter into 1/2 inch chunks and whisk in the sauce a little at a time. Season with salt and pepper.

Thinly slice steaks across the grain. Drizzle sauce and a little olive oil over steaks and serve.
