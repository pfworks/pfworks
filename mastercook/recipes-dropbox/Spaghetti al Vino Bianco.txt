  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1              pound  Swiss chard -- cut crosswise 1/2" pices and slices 1/2 inch thick
                        slat and pepper
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1             bottle  dry white wine
                        sugar
  1              pound  spaghetti

Heat 1 tbspn oil in a 12 inch skillet over med-high heat until shimmering. Add chard stems and 1/2 tspn salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until stems are crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes.

Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 1 tbspn salt and cook, stirring often, until pasta is flexible but not fully cooked, about 4 minutes. Reserve 2 cups cooking water, then drain pasta.

Transfer pasta to skillet with reduced white wine. Place skillet over medium heat; add 1/2 cup unreduced wine and cook, tossing constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Continue to add remaining wine, 1/2 cup at a time, tossing constantly, until pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes. Add pasta water, 1/2 cup at a time, if wine is fully absorbed before done.

Remove skillet from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup pasta water, butter, 3/4 cup parmesan, and cooked chard until sauce lightly coats pasta and is evenly distributed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to platter and sprinkle with remianing 1/4 cup cheese and pine nuts.
