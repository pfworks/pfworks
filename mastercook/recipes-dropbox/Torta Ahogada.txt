     1/4           cup  cilantro -- chopped
  3                     chipotle chile canned in adobo -- seeded and chopped
  2          teaspoons  adobo sauce
  1                     lime -- juiced
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1                cup  beef broth
                        meat
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2                     jalepeno -- seeded and minced
  1              pound  deli-sliced roast beef -- cut into strips
  4                     ciabatta or other crusty sandwich bread, halved and lightly toasted

In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the chopped tomatoes with chiles, sauce, cilantro, chipotles, adobo, lime juice and salt. Bring to a simmer, stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to gently cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Place a large skillet over med-high heat and add the oil. When hot, add the onions. Cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and jalepeno, stirring to incorporate. Cook and stir for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, until the onions are well browned and the garlic and jalepenos soften. Add the meat and toss until heated through and well combined, about 2 minutes. Add 3/4 cup of tomato sauce to the roast beef, tossing to coat.

Remove the sauce from the heat and add the broth. Using an immersion blender, puree the sauce until smooth, it should be thin. Ladle the sauce into 4 bowls for dippingt. Be sure the bowls are large enough to not spill.
