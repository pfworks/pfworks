                        crust
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2          teaspoons  dried sage -- finely crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  table salt
  16       tablespoons  chilled unsalted butter -- cut into small cubes
  3             ounces  sharp cheddar cheese -- finely grated
  6        tablespoons  ice water
  1                egg  blended with 1 tbspn water
                        filling
  1 1/2         pounds  (about 3 large) firm-sweet apples -- unpeeled, cored and cut into 1/4" wedges
  1 1/2         pounds  (about 3 large) firm-tart apples -- unpeeled, cored and cut into 1/4" wedges
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              small  onion -- finely chopped
  2             pounds  ground pork
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  ground clove
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
  3 1/2    tablespoons  plain breadcrumbs

First make the crust. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sage and salt until well combined. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the mixture and use your fingers to work them in. Do this until the mixture looks like cornmeal with some pea sized bits of butter remaining. Stir in the cheese with a fork unti evenly distributed. Sprinkle 6 tbspns ice water over the mixture and stir with a fork until the dough begins to come together. If needed, add and additional 1 or 2 tablespoons. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead three times. Gather the dough into a ball, then divide into two portions, making one slightly bigger than the other. Press each portion down into a disk and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Make the filling. In a skillet over med-low heat, cook the apples without any oil, stirring gently, until they just begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a dish and set aside. Add oil to the pan and increase heat to med-high. Add the onion, pork, brown sugar, salt and spices. Cook, using a wooden spoon to break up the meat, until it is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Let the meat mixture cool for 10 minutes, then transfer to a food processor. Add the breadcrumbs and pulse five times until the mixture has the texture of coarse sand. Set aside.

Prepare the crust. Unwrap the larger disk of doug and put it in the center of a large sheet of parchment paper. Cover the dough with a second piece. Roll out, working from the center, to a 13 inch circle. Peel off the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough to a pie plate, peeled side down. Peel off the remaining parchment and press the crust into the sides of the pie plate, draping any excess over the edge. Unwrap smaller disk of dough and put it in the center of parchment. Cover with a 2nd piece and roll out to an 11 inch circle. Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 and set a rack to the 2nd to bottom position. Fill the pie. Pour the meat mixture into the bottom crust and gently smooth top with a spatula. Arrange the cooked apple slices over the meat, pressing down to make the whole construction as smooth and neat as possible. Peel the top sheet of parchment off the crust. Transfer, peeled side down, to the pie, then peel off parchment. Using a sharp knife, make two 3 inch slashes in crust. Fold the edges of bottom crust up over the top and crimp to seal. Brush the crust with the egg wash and decorate with sage leaves. Bake at 525 for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 375 and bake unti lthe crust is golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes more. Remove from oven and let cool 25 minutes before serving.
