--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     red jalepenos -- stemmed and seeded
     1/2           cup  onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  sweet paprika
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  5             pounds  boneless pork butt
  2               cups  chicken stock

Combne the chiles, garlic, kosher salt, and paprika in a food processor and pulse until a paste is formed. Transfer the chile mixture to a large nonreactive bowl and add the wine, tomato paste and olive oil. Stir well.

Using a sharp knife, make deep slits all over the roast to allow the marinade to penetrate the meat. Add the pork to the bowl and turn to coat with the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, turning occassionally.

Preheat oven to 350 and bring meat to room temp.

Remove meat from marinade and tranfer to a roasting pan. Add chicken stock to pan and trnafer to oven. Bake for 1.5 hours, turning occasionally, or until browned on all sides. Add water as necessary to prevent drippings from burning. Reduce temp to 300 and cook, turning occasionally for 4.5 hours longer. Set meat aside for 15 minutes. Skim fat from pan. Using 2 forks, pull meat apart and toss with pan juices and season with salt.
