--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless beef chuck -- cut into 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  beef broth
  1                cup  Guiness
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  drained brine-packed green peppercorn -- coarsely chopped
  2              fresh  thyme sprigs
                        Rough Puff Pastry Dough
  1              large  egg -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  water

Special equipment: 4 14 oz bowls or ramekins, 4-5 inches wide and oven-safe

Put oven rack in middle and preheat oven to 350.

Pat beef dry. Stir together flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Add beef, turning to coat, then shake off excess and transfer to a plate. Heat oil in a wide 5-6 quart ovenproof heavy pot over moderately high heat until just smoking, then brown meat in 3 batches, turning occassionally, about 5 minutes per batch, transferring to a bowl.

Add onion, garlic, and water to pot and cook, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pot and stirring frequently, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in beef with any juices accumulated in bowl, broth, beer, w-sauce, peppercorns and thyme and bring to a simmer, then cover and transfer to oven. Braise until beef is very tender and sauce is thickened, about 1.5 hours. Discard thyme and cool stew completely, uncovered, about 30 minutes.

Put a shallow baking pan on middle rack of oven and increase oven temperature to 425.

Divide cooled stew among bowls (they won't be completely full). Roll out pastry dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13 inch square, about 1/8" thick. Trim edges and cut dough into quarters. Stir together egg and water and brush a 1" border of egg wash around each square. Invert 1 square over each bowl and drape, pressing sides lightly to help adhere. Brush pastry tops with some of the remaining egg wash and freeze 15 minutes to chill dough.

Bake pies in preheated baking pan until pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Reduce oven temperature to 400 and bake 5 minutes more.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  13       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- frozen
  6        tablespoons  ice water

Sift together flour and salt into a large chilled metal bowl. Set a grater in flour mixture and coarsely grate frozen butter into flour, gently lifting flour and tossing to coat butter.

Drizzle 5 tablespoons ice water evenly over flour mixure and gently stir with a fork until incorporated.

Test mixture be gently squeezing a small handful: When it has the proper texture, it will hold together without crumbling apart. If neccessary, add another tablespoon water, stirring until just incorporated and testing again.

Gather mixture together and form into a 5 inch square, then chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, about 30 minutes. (Dough will be lumpy and streaky)

Roll out dough on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin into a 15 by 8 inch rectangle. Arrange dough with a short side nearest you, then fold dough into thirds like a letter: bottom third up and top third down over dough. Rewrap dough and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.

Arrange dough with a short side nearest you on a floured surface and repeat rolling out, folding, and chilling 2 more times. Brush off any excess flour, then wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill at least 1 hour.
