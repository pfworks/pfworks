  2          teaspoons  dried basil
     1/2      teaspoon  dried rosemary
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        chicken
  3             pounds  bone-in chicken pieces
  2        tablespoons  whole allspice berries
  2        tablespoons  dried thyme
  2        tablespoons  dried rosemary
  2        tablespoons  water
  1                cup  wood chips -- soaked for 15 minutes and drained

Spice paste: Grind coriander, allspice, and pepper until coarsely ground. Transfer spices to blender. Add remaining ingredients and process until smooth paste forms, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to gallon-sized ziploc bag.

Place chicken pieces in a bag with spice paste and toss to coat; press out as much air as possible and seal bag. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes while preparing grill, flipping bag after 15 minutes.

Combine allspice berries, dried thyme, dried rosemary and water in bowl and set aside to moisten for 15 minutes. Using large piece of aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips and moistend mixture in foil packet and cut several holes.

Charcoal: Open bottom vent halfway. Arrange 1 quart of charcaol in single layer over half of grill. Light chimney filled 1/3. When ashy, pour on top of charcoal, keeping coals on half of grill. Place wood chip packet on top of coals. Set grate in place, cover, and open lid vent halfway. Heat until hot and wood chips are smoking, about 5 minutes.

Gas: Place wood chip packet over primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot and chips are smoking, about 15 minutes. Turn primary burner to medium and turn off other burners.

Clean and oil grate. Place chicken, with marinade clinging, skin sided up, as far away from fire as possible with thighs closest to fire and breasts furthest away. Cover, positioning vent over chicken, and cook 30 minutes.

Slide chicken, skin side down, to hotter side of grill; cook until brown and skin renders, 3 to 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken pieces and cook until browned on second side and breasts register 160 and thighs/drumsticks register 175, 3 to 9 mintues longer.

Transfer to platter, tent loosely, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve warm.
