--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dijon mustard
     1/4           cup  prepared horseradish
     3/4           cup  dried bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  dried rosemary
  6             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  freshly ground black pepper
  1                     6-8 lb standing prime rib roast (4 ribs) chine bone removed
     1/2           cup  prepared horseradish
     1/2           cup  sour cream

To make the crust, in a small bowl, mix together the mustard, 1/4 cup horseradish, bread crumbs, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper. Rub the mixture all over the meat and let stand for 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 350. Oil a roasting pan just large enough to hold the roast. Place the roast, fat side up, in the pan and roast until nicely browned, about 1 hour. Remove at 125 for rare or 130 for med rare. Transfer meat to a carving board and let rest, loosely tented in foil, for 10-12 minutes.

Whisk 1/2 cup horseradish and sour cream together in a small bowl. Carve the roast into thick or thin pieces and serve with the horseradish sauce.
