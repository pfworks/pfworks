  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  1 1/4           cups  vegetable broth
  1                cup  canned crushed tomatoes
  1 1/2    tablespoons  chile powder
     1/4      teaspoon  5 spice powder or cinnamon
  2                     15 oz cans beans (like kidney or black) -- rinsed and drained
  2        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
  2               cups  cooked brown rice

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over med-high heat; add the jalapenos, onions and vinegar and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 30 seconds.

Stir in the broth, tomatoes, chile powder and 5 spice powder and increase heat to high. Bring to a full oil and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the beans and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until just slightly thickened but still soupy, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro.
