  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3 1/2         pounds  fillet of beef -- room temp
                        chipotle red pepper sauce
  3               cups  thinly sliced red bell peppers (about 13)
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                can  chipotle chile canned in adobo
  2          teaspoons  worcestershire sauce
                        mustard chive sauce
     1/2           cup  dry mustard
  3        tablespoons  distilled white vinegar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into bits and softened
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh chives

In a heavy, flameproof roasting pan heat the oil over moderate high heat until it is hot but not smoking, add the beef, patted dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, and brown it, turning it every 2 minutes, for 10 minutes. Roast the beef in a preheated 500 oven for 12-15 minutes, or until 130. Serve beef with sauces.

In a heavy skillet cook the bell peppers in the oil, covered, over moderately low heat, stirring ocassionally, for 25-30 minutes, or until they are soft. In a blender puree the mixture with the chipotle, the worcestshire sauce, and salt to taste.

In a small bowl, stir together the mustard, vinegar, sugar, salt and 3 tablespoons water, making a smooth paste, and let the mixture stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water and whisk in the butter until it is just melted and incorporated thouroughly. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the chives.
