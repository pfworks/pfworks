--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  fresh broccoli -- florets removed
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  orange zest
                        juice from 1 orange
                        salt and pepper
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled and smashed

Preheat oven to 425.

Put 2/3 of the broccoli in a large bowl with the olive oil and orange juice; season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet in 1 layer and roast until just tender with golden brown edges, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour cream into a medium heavy saucepan, add the remaining broccoli, garlic, and orange zest and bring to a gentle simmer over med-low heat. Cook until cream is reduced by half and broccoli is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

Blend cream and broccoli mixture until coarsely blended and a little chunky. Gently fold in roasted broccoli and adjust seasoning. Serve warm.
