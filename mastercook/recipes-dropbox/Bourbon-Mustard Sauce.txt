--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4           cup  shallot -- finely chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2           cup  good quality bourbon
     3/4           cup  whipping cream
     3/4           cup  beef stock
  3        tablespoons  grainy mustard
                        salt
                        black pepper -- freshly ground

In a small heavy saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots and garlic, cover and cook without browning, stirring occassionally for 3 minutes. Uncover, add the bourbon, and increase the heat to high. Simmer briskly, stirring often, until the bourbon is reduced to half, 2 to 3 minutes.

Decrease the heat and whisk in the cream, stock, mustard and 1/2 tspn of salt. Bring to a brisk simmer, partially cover and cook, stirring occassionally, until the sauce is reduced about 1/3 and has thickened, 12-15 minutes. Add black pepper to taste.
