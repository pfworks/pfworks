     1/4         ounce  pacjage active dry yeast ( 2 1/4 teaspoons)
  2               cups  unbleached all purpose flour
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil

Stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/4 cup warm water in a measuring cup and let stand until mixture appears creamy on surface, about 5 minutes.

Stir together 1.25 cups flour and salt in a large bowl, then add yeast mixture, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup warm water and stir until smooth. Stir in enough of remaining flour for dough to come away from side of bowl. (the dough will be slightly wetter than other pizza doughs)

Knead dough on work surface with floured hands, reflouring work surface and hands when dough becomes too sticky, until dough is smooth, soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Divide in half and form 2 balls, then generously dust balls all over with flour and put each in medium bowl. Cover bowls with plastic wrap and let dough rise until doubled in builk, about 75 minutes.
