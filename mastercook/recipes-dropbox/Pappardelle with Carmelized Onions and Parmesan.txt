--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2             medium  onion -- halved and thinly sliced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
                        coarse salt and pepper
  8 3/4         ounces  pappardelle
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2             ounces  shaved parmesan

In a large skillet, heat oil over medium. Add onions and thyme; season with salt and pepper. Cover, and cook, without stirring, until onions have released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Uncover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 25-30 minutes more. When bottom of skillet darkens, add a few tablespoons water, and scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon.

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When onions have about 10 minutes left to cook, add pasta to water in pot, and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup and return pasta to pot.

Add onions and butter to pasta in pot; season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Gradually add enough pasta water to create a thin sauce that coats pasta. Serve topped with Parmesan.
