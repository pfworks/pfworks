--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  whole wheat breadcrumbs
  2        tablespoons  whole wheat breadcrumbs
  2          teaspoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
                        kosher salt
  4                     plum tomato -- 2 chopped and 2 thinly sliced
  2              large  egg
  2                     egg white
     1/2           cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  milk
     1/4           cup  basil leaves -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  part-skim mozzarella -- shredded

Preheat oven to 350. Coat a 9 inch deep sided pie pan with cooking spray. Evenly sprinkle 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs into the pan.

Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium low heat. Add the onion and 1/8 tspn salt and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions soften without color, about 15 minutes. Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook for 1 minute. Transfer to medium bowl and set aside.

Meanwhile, add the eggs, whites, ricotta, milk, the remaining 1/3 cup crumbs and 3/4 tspn salt to a blender until well combined and smooth. Stir in the sliced basil and the onion-tomato mixture.

Pour the egg mixture into the prepared pie pan. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Arrange slice tomatoes in an overlapping style around the top.

Bake until the eggs are set and the cheese is lightly browned, about 35 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes to complete cooking process. Garnish with the fresh basil sprig. Slice into 4 wedges with a sharp knife and serve.
