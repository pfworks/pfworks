--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  28            ounces  whole tomatoes in juice, drained
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  6             ounces  mozzarella cheese
                        Pizza Dough (Bianco)
                        flour
  8             medium  fresh basil leaf -- torn

Seed and chop tomatoes.

Simmer tomatoes, salt, and 2 tablespoons oil in a 10 inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until very thick and reduced to about 1 cup, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to bowl to cool.

Toss grated cheese and remaining olive oil.

Do not punch down dough. Gently dredge 1 ball of dough in a bowl of flour to coat, then transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Holding 1 edge of floured dough in the air with both hands and letting bottom touch work surface, carefully move hands around of dough (like turning a steering wheel), allowing weight of dough to stratch round to roughly 7 inches in diameter. Lay dough round flat on floured surface and continue to stretch by pressing dough with your fingertips, working from center outward to edge, stretching into 9 inch round. Transfer to a large floured tray and make another round. Lightly rub a long sheet of plastic wrap with flour, then invert loosely over pizza rounds and let them stand to puff slightly while preparing grill, 10 to 20 minutes.

Remove plastic wrap from dough and lightly brush with oil. Carefully flip rounds, oil side down, with your hands onto middle of lightly oiled grill rack and brush top of each with oil. Grill over indirect heat, uncovered, until undersides are golden brown (2-3 minutes gas, 4-6 minutes charcoal)

Flip crusts over with tongs and a spatula and top each crust with half of tomato sauce, spreading evenly and leaving 1/2" border. Sprinkle cheese evenly and grill pizzas, covered, until undersides are golden brown and cheese is melted. (3 minutes gas, 5 minutes charcoal)

Scatter basil over pizzas.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         ounce  pacjage active dry yeast ( 2 1/4 teaspoons)
  2               cups  unbleached all purpose flour
     3/4           cup  warm water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil

Stir together yeast, 1 tablespoon flour, and 1/4 cup warm water in a measuring cup and let stand until mixture appears creamy on surface, about 5 minutes.

Stir together 1.25 cups flour and salt in a large bowl, then add yeast mixture, oil, and remaining 1/2 cup warm water and stir until smooth. Stir in enough of remaining flour for dough to come away from side of bowl. (the dough will be slightly wetter than other pizza doughs)

Knead dough on work surface with floured hands, reflouring work surface and hands when dough becomes too sticky, until dough is smooth, soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Divide in half and form 2 balls, then generously dust balls all over with flour and put each in medium bowl. Cover bowls with plastic wrap and let dough rise until doubled in builk, about 75 minutes.
