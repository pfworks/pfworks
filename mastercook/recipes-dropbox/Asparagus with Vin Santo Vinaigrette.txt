  1 1/2           cups  vin santo
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  1              bunch  asparagus -- bottoms trimmed
  6                     leaves Bibb lettuce
  1                     hard boiled egg -- sliced
     1/4           cup  toasted almonds -- chopped

In a small saucepan over medium heat, reduce the vin santo to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, combine the vin santo, lemon juice, mustard, salt and pepper. Whisk to combine, dissolving mustard. While whisking, slowly add olive oil.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add asparagus. Cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl filled with ice water and cool about 3 minutes. Remove and pat dry.

Place lettuce on platter and top with asparagus, then slices of egg and chopped almonds. Drizzle entire platter with vinaigrette.
