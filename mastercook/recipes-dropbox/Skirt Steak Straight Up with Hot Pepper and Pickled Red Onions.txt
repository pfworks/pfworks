--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  skirt steak
  2        tablespoons  red pepper flakes
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        olive oil
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil for frying
                        Pickled Onions
  1              large  red onion
     1/3           cup  water
     1/2           cup  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  raw sugar
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Prepare steaks by sprinkling on the red pepper flakes and then generously salting them. Let them come to room temperature, then oil them before grilling/frying.

For the onions, peel and then slice the onion into as thin as possible rounds. Place in a bowl.

Combine water, vinegar, and sugar in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a boil and pour over onions. Crush the coriander and add it, along with olive oil, to the onions. Let cool and drain before using. Save the liquid to store any leftover onions.

Slice meat across grain (up and down length) creating long, thin slices. Top with onions.
