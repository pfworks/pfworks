  3              whole  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
                        filling
  6             ounces  soft goat cheese
  2          teaspoons  fresh thyme leaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo
                        coating
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  2                     egg
     3/4           cup  milk
  1 1/4           cups  bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  pecans -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  chimayo chile powder
  1         tablespoon  lemon zest -- finely chopped
                        Pan Applesauce

Prehat oven to 375.

Separate the chicken breasts by cutting down both sides of the center bit of gristle. Discard gristle. Pull aside the tenderloin from the center and find the depression at the base of the thickest part of the breast. Insert a sharp knife and gently cut a pocket. If you pivot the kinfe at the entry point, you will leave an opening that will hold the filling while cooking.

Mix the goat cheese, thyme and chipotle. Stuff the opening in the chicken breast with 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of the mixture, pressing it inside the opening with your fingers. Fold the tenderloin over the hole to seal.

For the coating, combine the flour, salt and pepper. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with the milk. In a third bowl, mix the crumbs, pecans, chile and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken breasts first in the flour, then the eggwash and then coat with crumb mixture. Set aside for 5 minutes.

Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the breasts on sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes or until done. Serve with pan applesauce.
