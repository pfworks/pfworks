  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  instant yeast

  16            slices  deli provolone cheese

For the dough: In stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, semolina, sugar, and yeast and low speed until combined, about 2 seconds. With machine running, slowly add water and oil until dough forms and no dry flour remains, 1 to 2 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 10 minutes.

Add salt to dough and mix on medium speed until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears side of bowl, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from bowl and knead briefly on a lightly floured surface until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape into tight bowl and place in large, lightly oiled bowl. COver tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

For the sauce: Bring onion and water to boil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for one hour. Meanwhile, process remaning ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, and set aside.

Add tomato mixture to onion mixture and continue to cook, uncovered, until reduced to 2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl, cool to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate.

Pizza: One hour before baking pizza, place stone on upper middle racj and heat oven to 500. Spray rimmed baking sheet (including rim) with vegetable oil then coat bottom with oil. Remove dough from refrigerstor and transfer to lightly floured counter. Lightly flour top of dough and gently press into 9x12 rectangle. Roll to 1318. Transfer to sheet, fitting dough into corners. Spray top with vegetable oil and cover with plastic wrap. Place second baking sheet over dough and let stand for 1 hour.

Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan, oil, oregano and salt in bowl. Remove top baking sheet and wrap. Gently lift and stretch dough to fill pan. Shingle provolone over dogh. Spread sauce in thin layer over cheese, leaving 1/2" border. Sprinkle breadcrumb mixture over sauce and dough.

Place pizza on stone; reduce temp to 450 and bake until bottom crust is evenly browned, 18-22 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Run knife around rim. Transfer to cuttingboard, cut into squares, and serve.
