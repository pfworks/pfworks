                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        canola or vegetable oil
                        baste
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  10            cloves  garlic -- crushed
     1/4           cup  savory herbs such as rosemary, thyme, marjoram, oregano and/or sage -- finely chopped
                        board dressing
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
                        kosher salt

Generously season the steaks with salt and pepper. Press in the seasoning, and dab the meat on the board to collect excess.

Glisten the meat with the oil, using the first steak to brush oil onto the others.

Preheat BBQ to med-high.

Put the meat on the well-oiled grill and cook until medium rare.

Baste regularly, stacking and/or flipping the meat if the flames get out of control.

When the steaks are nicely carmelized and charred on both sides, approximately 15-25 minutes, they are done. The steaks should register about 125.

Combine the board dressing ingredients.

Let the steaks rest for 2 minutes, the pour dressing onto a cutting board and slice the steaks, turning to coat all sides.
