  1                     3 inch piece of ginger -- peeled and chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- peeled
     3/4           cup  dark brown sugar -- packed
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  4             pounds  chicken wings -- halved at joint and wingtips removed
     1/4           cup  water

Pulse ginger, garlic, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tbspn soy sauce, and 1/4 tspn cayenne in a food processor until finely ground. Add mixture to slow cooker insert. Add chicken and toss until combined.

Cover and cook on low until fat renders and chicken is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Using slotted spoon, remove wings from slow cooker and transfer to clean large bowl (discard liquid in slow cooker). Let wings cool 20 minutes.

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler. Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet and spray rack with baking spray. Whisk water,tomato paste, remaining sugar, remaining soy sauce, and remaining cayenne in a bowl. Add half of sauce to bowl with cooled wings and toss gently to coat. Arrange wings, skin side up, on prepared rack. Broil until wings are lightly charred  and crisp around edges, 10 to 15 minutes. Flip wings, brush with remaining sauce, and continue to broil until well carmelized, about 3 minutes. Serve.
