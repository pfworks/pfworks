  4             pounds  boneless chuck or bottom round roast
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  12                    pepperoncini pepper
  2        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2          teaspoons  apple cider vinegar

Rub salt and pepper into roast. Sprinkle with flour and massage it in.

Heat oil in a large saute pan over high heat until it is shimmering and about to smoke. Place roast in pan and brown on all sides, 4-5 minutes a side, to create a crust. Remove from pan and place in slow cooker. Add the butter and pepperoncini. Cover and set to low.

As it heats, make a dressinf. Combine mayo, vinegar, dill and paprika in a bowl and whisk to emulsify. Add buttermilk and whisk again. Remove lid from slow cooker and add the dressing. Cover and cook for 6-8 hours. Shred meat with forks and mix in gravy. Garnish with parsley.
