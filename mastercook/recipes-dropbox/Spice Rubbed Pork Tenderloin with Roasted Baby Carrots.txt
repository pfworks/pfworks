  1           teaspoon  smoked paprika

Arrange carrots on large, rimmed baking sheet. Whisk 2 tbps water and all remaining ingredients in a small bow; pour over carrots and toss to coat. Cover tightly with heavy-duty foil. Let stand at room temperature. Toss to coat before continuing.

Preheat oven to 400. Roast carrot mixture covered until just tender, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, arrange pork tenderloins on another rimmed baking sheet. Stir oregano, cumin, chile powder, paprika, and 1 tspn salt in small bowl; rub mixture all over tenderloins. Heat oil in a large, heavy nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add pork to skillet and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Return to baking sheet.

Remove foil from carrots. Nestle pork among carrots on baking sheet, arranging in single layer around pork. Roast uncovered until center of pork registers 145, stirring carrots occasionally if they start to carmelize, aboout 18 minutes. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes.

Transfer pork to work surface and cut crosswise into 1/2" slices. Arrange carrots on platter and top with pork, drizzling pan juices over the top.
