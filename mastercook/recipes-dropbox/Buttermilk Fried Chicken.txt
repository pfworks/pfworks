     1/4           cup  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  cayenne
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
                        ground fleur del sel or fine sea salt
                        rosemary or thyme sprigs for garnish

Combine all brine ingredients in a large pot, cover, and bring to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve salt. Remove from het and cool, then chill before using.

Cut each chicken into 10 pieces: 2 legs, 2 thighs, 4 breast quarters and 2 wings. Pour brine into a container large enough to hold the chicken pieces, add the chicken and refrigerate for 12 hours.

Remove chicken from brine and rinse under cold water, removing any herbs or spices attached to chicken. Pat with paper towels and let air dry. Let rest at room temperature for 1.5 hours.

Cook dark meat first, then turn up the heat and cook white meat. Fill pot with 2 inches of oil and heat to 320. Set a cooling rack over baking sheet. Line 2nd sheet with parchment paper.

Combine coating ingredients (flour to black pepper) in a large bowl. Transfer half to 2nd large bowl. Pour buttermilk in a third bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set up a dipping station: chicken, coating, buttermilk, coating, parchment lined baking sheet.

Dip the thighs in coating, then buttermilk, then coating.

Lower things in oil. Adjust heat to return to 320. Fry for 2 minutes then move around and continue to fry, turning as necessary for 11-12 minutes, until deep brown and golden, and crisp. Meanwhile, coat drumsticks and place on parchment.

Transfer thighs to cooling rack skin side up and let rest. Cook drumsticks. When done, lean them meat side up against thighs to drain, then sprinkle with sea salt.

Turn heat up to 340. Coat wings and breasts. Lower breasts and fry for 7 minutes. Transfer to rack, sprinkle with salt, and turn skin side up. Cook wings for 6 minutes. Transfer to platter and turn off heat.

Arrange on platter. Add sprigs to oil and let them crisp for a few seconds and arrange over chicken.
