                        kosher salt

  1                     jalapeno -- stemmed, seeded and diced

                        Fire-Roasted Jalapeno Aioli
  1              bunch  baby watercress
  1              bunch  cilantro
  1                     red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded and julienned
  1                     english cucumber -- peeled and cut on diagonal into 1.25" rounds

                        Serve
                        Crispy Fried Onion Strings

Preheat oven to 400. To the meat, add half of the sugar, half of the brown sugar, 1.5 tspns salt, 1 tspn pepper and 1 tablespoon of oil. Next, combine remaining sugars, vinegar, wine, soy and fish sauces in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.

Dive the meat into 2 portions. Place 2 large skillets over the highest heat possible and add 1 tablespoon of oil to each skillet. When the oil begins to smoke, add 1/2 the meat in 1 layer to each pan. Let sit until a brown crust forms, and turn to brown the other side. Browing should take about 2-3 minutes. Set aside, drain 1 skillet of excess oil and wipe down with paper towel.

In that skillet, add 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke, add the onion, bell pepper and jalapeno with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often until lightly carmelized, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and green onions and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes. While the onion mixture is cooking, place the 4 baguettes in the oven for 1 to 2 minutes until lightly toasted and warmed through. Add the beef and vinegar mixture to the onions, and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.

To assemble each sandwich, spread 1 tablespoon of aioli on both sides of the baguette. On the bottom half, add a small handful of watercress, then 1/4 of the meat mixture, top with a small handful of cilantro, some bell pepper, a few slices of cucumber, and a few slices of jalapeno. Serve with limes, aioli for dipping and crispy fried onions strings.
