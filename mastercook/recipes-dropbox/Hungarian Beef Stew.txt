--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3 1/2         pounds  boneless beef chuck eye roast -- 1.5" cubes
     1/2           cup  sweet paprika
  1                     12 oz jar roasted red peppers -- drained and rinsed
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3          teaspoons  white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4              large  onions -- minced
  4                     carrot -- peeled and cut into 1" rounds
  1                     bay leaf
  1                cup  beef broth
     1/4           cup  sour cream
                        pepper

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325. Sprinkle the meat evenly with 1 tspn salt and let stand for 15 minutes. Process the paprika, roasted peppers, tomato paste, and 2 tspns of the vinegar in a food processor until smooth, for 1 to 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.

Combine the oil, onions and 1 tspn salt in a large Dutch oven; cover and set over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions soften but have not yet begun to brown, 8-10 minutes.

Stir in the paprika mixture; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions stick to the bottom of the pan, about 2 minutes. Add the beef, carrots, and bay leaf; stir until the beef is well coated. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the pot. Cover the pot and transfer to the oven. Cook until the meat is almost tender and the surface of the liquid is 1/2" below the top of the meat, 2-2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes. Remove the pot from the oven and add enough broth so that the surface of the liquid is 1/4" from the top of the meat. Return covered to the oven and continue to cook until fork tender, about 30 minutes.

Skim the fat off of the surface; stir in the remaining 1 tspn of vinegar and the sour cream. Remove and discard the bay leaf, seaon with salt and pepper and serve.
