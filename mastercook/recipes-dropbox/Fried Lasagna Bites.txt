  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil, plus more for frying
     1/2         pound  sweet italian sausage
     1/2         pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  white onion -- diced
  1         tablespoon  Italian seasoning
     1/4           cup  basil leaf -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground black pepper
  16            ounces  tomato sauce
  1         tablespoon  red pepper flakes
  1              pound  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
  1              quart  cottage cheese -- strained
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  3                     egg -- beaten
  2               cups  plain bread crumbs

Boil pasta for 6 minutes, then drain and spread on a sheet pan to cool.

Heat a large saute pan with 1 tbspn oil over med-high heat. Add sausage, ground beef and onions; saute for 3 minutes. Add the Italian seasoning, basil and black pepper. Cook for about 8 minutes, until the meat has browned. Stir in 1/2 cup tomato sauce and cook until heated through. Set aside in bowl to cool.

Fold the mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese into the cooled meat mixture. Stuff each shell with meat mixture and then place in freezer for 5 minutes to firm up. When ready to fry, cut each shell into thirds.

Preheat oil to 350.

Place flour, eggs, and bread crumbs in separate bowls.

Dredge the shells in the flour, then eggs, then crumbs.

Fry bites until golden brown and crispy, 4-5 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve with spicy tomato sauce.
