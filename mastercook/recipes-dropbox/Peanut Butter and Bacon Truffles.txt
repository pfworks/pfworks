--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     strips very crisp, cooked bacon -- well drained
     1/2           cup  salted dry roasted peanuts
  4          teaspoons  sugar
     1/4           cup  smooth peanut butter
  8             ounces  semisweet chocolate chips
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder

Put bacon, peanuts, and sugar into a food processor and pulse until mixture is ground to a medium fine texture. Transfer bacon-peanut mixture to a small bowl, add peanut butter, and stir until thoroughly combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill peanut butter mixture in refrigerator until firm.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment or waxed paper and set aside. Roll mixture in 1" balls and put them on the prepared cookie sheet. Drape plastic wrap over peanut butter balls and chill in the refrigerator until firm.

Meanwhile, melt chocolate chips in a small heatproof bowl set over a small pot of simmering water over med-low heat, stirring often, until smooth. Remove bowl from heat and set aside to let chocolate cool until warm. Sift cocoa into another bowl and set aside.

Working with a few of the balls at a time, roll them in the melted chocolate, coating them evenly. Transfer truffles to bowl of cocoa powder, dredging truffles completely. Truffles will keep at room temperature in an airtight container with some cocoa for 2 days, in the fridge for up to a week, or freezer for a month. Serve at room temperature.
