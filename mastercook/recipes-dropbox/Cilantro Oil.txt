--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  packed fresh cilantro -- stems removed
  1                cup  canola oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the cilantro and blanch for 10 seconds. Remove and shock in an ice bath. Pat dry well on paper towels, squeezing to remove excess water. Roughly chop and transfer to blender. With the machine running, add the oil, salt and cayenne and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover, abd refrigerate overnight. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, pressing with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible. Transfer to a squirt bottle and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.
