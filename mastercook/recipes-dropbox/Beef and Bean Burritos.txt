                        Rice
  1 1/2           cups  low sodium chicken broth
     3/4           cup  long grain white rice
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  cilantro -- minced
                        beef and bean filling
     1/2           cup  low sodium chicken broth
  15            ounces  canned pinto beans -- rinsed
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1           teaspoon  chipotle chile powder
  12            ounces  90% ground beef
  1         tablespoon  lime juice
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  6                     10" tortillas
  10            ounces  cheddar cheese -- shredded
  6        tablespoons  sour cream

For the rice: Bring broth, rice, garlic, and salt to boil in small saucepan over med-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and all liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes. Add cilantro, fluff rice with fork, cover, and set aside.

Filling: Meanwhile, combine broth and half of beans in medium bowl. Using potato masher, coarsely mash beans together with broth. Heat oil in 12  inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, garlic, cumin, oregano, and chile powder and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add beef, breaking up pieces with spoon, and cook until no longer pink, 8-10 minutes.

Stir mashed bean mixture into meat mixture. Cook, stirring constantly, until nearly all liquid has evaporated, about 3 minutes. Stir in remaining beans, lime juice, and salt. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside.

Adjust oven rack 3 inches from broiler and turn on broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wrap tortillas in clean dish towel and microwave until soft and pliable, about 90 seconds. Arrange tortillas on counter. Divide rice, beef and bean mixturem and 1.5 cups cheddar evenly among tortillas. Dollop each tortilla with 1 tbspn sour cream. Fold sides of tortilla over filling, fold bottom of tortilla over sides and filling, and roll tightly. Transfer to prepared sheet, seam side down.

Sprinkle remaining 1 cup cheddar over burritos. Transfer to oven and broil until cheddar is melted and starting to brown, 3-5 minutes, rotating halfway through. Serve.
