--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pineapple juice
     3/4           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  red jalepeno chiles -- seeded and chopped
     3/4      teaspoon  allspice -- ground
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  2                     3/4 lb pork tenderloins
                        fresh cilantro -- chopped

Preheat oven to 500. Bring 3/4 cup pineapple juice and sugar to boil in heavy large saucepan over high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cover; boil until syrup is deep brown, checking frequently to prevent burining, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Immediately swirl in remaining 1/4 cup pineapple juice, chiles and allspice. When bubbling stops, whisk in lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup glaze into bowl and reserve.

Line baking sheet with foil; place rack in center of sheet. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper; place on rack. Brush with glaze from saucepan. Roast until 145, brushing with glaze from saucepan occasionally, about 15 minutes. Slice pork. Drizzle with reserved glaze and sprinkle with cilantro.
