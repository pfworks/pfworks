  1              pound  boneless beef chuck -- 1/2" cubes

                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  2                     yellow onion -- finely chopped
  6             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin

Toast chiles in a medium, dry skillet over med-high heat, turning occasionally and pressing down until darkened and beginning to soften, about 3 minutes.

Puree chiles and broth in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute and set aside.

Heat 1 tbspn oil in a large, heavy pot over med-high heat. Season chuck, ribs and brisket with salt and pepper. Cook until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Cook until liquid had evaporated, 8-10 minutes more. Transfer beef to a plate.

Heat 1 tbspn oil in same pot, then add onins and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until onions are softened, 6-8 minutes. Scrape up brown bits. Add cumin, oregano and chipotle and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute.

Transfer to a 4-6 quart slow cooker. Add lager, beef, chile puree, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cover and cook until meat is very tender, 7-8 hours on low of 4-5 hours on high. If too thin, simmer.

Taste and season. Serve with garnish.
