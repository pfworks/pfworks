  1                     frozen prepared deep-dish pie crust
  8             ounces  fire roasted mild Hatch or other chile peppers -- seeded and sliced into strips
  8             ounces  cheddar-montery jack cheese blend -- shredded
     1/4           cup  texas sweet or vidalia onions -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  olive oil
  4              large  eggs -- beated
     1/4           cup  wood chips, soaked in water and drained, or 1/2 cup for gas
  9             ounces  hickory or maple smoked bacon, cooked until crisp -- chopped

Fill chimney with briquets, set the chimney on bottom grill grate, and light or prepare a fire in smoker. For gas grill, turn half the burners to high.

Line the bottom and sides of pie crust with the chile pepper strips, reserving a few to garnish top. Top with cheese, spreading it out evenly.

In a small saute pan over med heat, saute the onions in the olive oil until softened, about 3 minutes. In a medium sized bowl, combine the eggs and onion, then pour the mixture over the cheese. Arrange reserved chile slices on top.

When the coals are ready, dump them in the bottom of the gril, and spread them evenly across half. Scatter the wood chips on the hot coals, or put the chips in a metal container closest to a burner on a gas grill. Place the pie on the indirect side of the grill. When the smoke starts to rise, close the lid.

Smoke bake the pie at 350 to 40 to 45 minutes, or until crust has browned, the filling has set and it has a mild, smoky aromoa. Sprinkle with bacon before serving.
