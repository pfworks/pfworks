                        crust
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  cornmeal
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  vermont cheese powder
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter -- chilled
     3/4           cup  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  ice water
                        filling
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1              pinch  cayenne
     1/2      teaspoon  dried cilantro (coriander)
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground clove
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/4           cup  roasted red pepper -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  jalapeno pepper -- chopped
     1/2           cup  pimiento stuffed green olives -- chopped
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
                        salt and pepper
  1              large  potato -- cooked, peeled and mashed

To make the dough: Combine the flour, cornmeal, salt and cheese powder either in a large bowl or in a food processor.

Work the chilled butter into the dry ingredients, using a pastry blender or food processor, until pea-sized clumps begin to form.

Mix in the cheese, followed by 1/4 cup of water, adding more if necessary to bring the dough together.

Shape the dough into 3 equal disks, wrap them in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

To make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large pan set over medium heat. Add onion, garlic salt, cumin, cayenne, cilantro, cinnamon and cloves, and cook until the onion is softened.

Turn the heat up to med-high and add the ground beef. Cook the mixture, stirring and breaking up any lumps, until the meat is no longer pink.

Add the roasted red pepeprs, jalepenos, olives, raisins, and salt and pepper to taste.

Add the mashed potato and stir to incorporate.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl, and allow to cool as you roll and cut the dough.

Roll out one disk of dough 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Using a lattice pie mold, or a 4" to 5" plate and a sharp knife, cut out 10 circles, 5 bottom layers and 5 top layers with a lattice pattern (or vents and holes). Repeat the process with 2nd and 3rd disk.

Using two tablespoons of filling per pie, place on each of the bottom pieces, then top with top piece and seal edges with pie mold or tines of fork.

Place the pies on a parchment lined baking sheet, and freeze for 30 minutes or longer. Preheat oven to 400.

Bake the pies for 20-25 minutes, until they are golden brown. Cool 10 minutes on rack.
