                        pasta filling
                        salt to taste
     3/4         pound  short ziti, penne or other tubular macaroni
  1                cup  Bechamel Sauce
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
  1 1/2           cups  Simple Tomato Sauce
                        meatballs
  2             slices  stale white bread -- crusts removed and cubed
  4        tablespoons  milk
     3/4         pound  ground beef
  1              ounce  prosciutto -- sliced and coarsely chopped
     1/2         small  onion -- coarsely grated
  1         tablespoon  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
  1         tablespoon  fresh flat-leaf parsley -- chopped
  1                     egg white -- beaten
                        vege oil for frying
                        flour for dredging
                        pastry crust
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached white flour -- chilled
  1           teaspoon  salt, plus xtra pinch
     3/4         pound  unsalted butter -- chilled
     2/3           cup  ice water
  2                     egg -- beaten
                        unsalted butter and flour for coating pan
  1                     egg -- separated

Mix the flour and the teaspoon of salt. Cut the butter into the flour with two knives, a pastry cutter or in a food processor on low speed, until thumbnail sized pieces are formed.

Mix the ice water into the beaten eggs. Slowly add the liquid to the flour mixture and stir by hand until the dough holds together when pinched. If there is too much liquid for the dough, do noy use it all. If using a food processor, engage for only 5 minutes.

Quickly gather up the dough into 2 balls, making one about twice the size of the other. Press each ball into a thick disk and wrap loosely in plastic wrap. Chill 2 hours.

Combine meatball ingredients in a bowl. Shape into balls about the size of large olives.

Heat oil in frying pan. When hot enough to make meatballs sizzle, dredge lightly in flour and fry until browned and cooked, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

Preheat oven to 375.

Roll pastry disks on a floured surface until 1/8" thick.

Butter 8" springform pan and dust with flour. Roll the larger disk around a rolling pin and transfer to pan. Unroll it gently, centering it over the pan. Gently push the pastry into the bottom of the pan and shape it up the sides. Do not trim excess.

Brush inside of pie crust with egg white and allow to dry. Combine remaining egg white with the yolk and a pinch of salt and set aside.

Cook the pasta until not quite al dente. Drain and toss with bechamel and parmesan. Combine with meatballs and tomato sauce.

Turn the sauced pasta and meatballs into the pastry casing. Drape the second pastry disk over a rolling pin and center it. It should rest evenly on the top of the pan. Crimp the edged and do not overlap edges of pan. Cut off excess pastry and save.

Cut a small hole in the center of top pie crust and roll out pastry scraps. Cut into decorative flower. Place over hole, leaving vents.

Brush entire crust with egg wash, not touching sides of pan. Bake for 1 hour or until golden. Let stand for 10 minutes, and the carefully remove pan ring. Slice and serve.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/4           cups  milk
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg -- freshly grated

Heat milk to just below boiling point and keep warm.

Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Working over low heat, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon or whisk to get rid of lumps. Let the flour and butter paste heat through for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Do not let the paste brown.

Add the hot milk, a tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly to incorporate it thoroughly. Continue to add the milk very slowly, just a few tablespoons at a time, until 1/2 cup is used up.

Add the rest of the milk in a very slow and gradual trickle, stirring all the time. Hold back a little of the milk is sauce is being used as a binding. If lumps appear, you are using too much milk, the heat is too high, or the milk is being added too quickly. Press the lumps against the side with the wooden spoon should this happen.

When all the milk has been added, simmer the sauce very gently for another 15 minutes or so, stirring constantly. Add the salt and nutmeg during the last 10 minutes of cooking.
