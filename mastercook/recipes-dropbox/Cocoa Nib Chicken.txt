  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast
  1                cup  cocoa nibs -- chopped or ground
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temp
  1           teaspoon  unsweetened chocolate -- grated
                        sauce
  1                cup  white wine
  4               cups  chicken stock
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  2               cups  fennel -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  cocoa nibs

Preheat oven to 400.

Rinse chicken under cold water, then pat dry using paper towels. Let stand at room temperature for 30 mintues.

While chicken is standing, combine 1 cup of ground cocoa nibs and butter to make a paste. Using a spoon, spread onto one side of each piece of chicken. Allow about 5 to 10 minutes for paste to firm up before searing.

Meanwhile, bring the chicken stock to a boil in a 2-qt heavy bottomed sauce pan.

Place a heavy duty skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Carefully place chicken, nib side down in preheated pan. Allow to sear for 2-3 minutes. Surface will start to smoke and butter will brown. Remove the chicken from the skillet and place on a baking tray, cocoa-side up. Allow the chicken to rest for 15-20 minutes. While the chicken is resting, prepare the sauce.

Add white wine to the hot skillet and simmer for one minute. Pour the simmering wine into the boiling stock and add salt, pepper, fennel and cocoa nibs. Continue to simmer until reduced by half, about 15 minutes.

While the sauce is reducing, place chicken in oven for about 15 minutes or until 165.

When the sauce has reduced by half, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve.

Slice the chick on a bias, arrange breasts on a warmed serving platter, and pour sauce over chicken.
