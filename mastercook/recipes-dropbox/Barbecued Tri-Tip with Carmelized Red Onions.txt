                        Red Onions
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             medium  red onions -- halved, thinly sliced
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  fresh chives -- chopped
                        Tri Tip
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  2                     1.5 lb beef loin tri tip roasts -- trimmed of fat 1/4"
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        Red Wine BBQ Sauce

Melt butter with olive oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook until deep golden brown, stirring frequently, about 30 minutes. Stir in vinegar, 1/2 tspn salt, and 1/4 tspn pepper. Remove from heat. Stir in chives.

Prepare BBQ (med heat). Mix garlic powder, 1 tspn salt, and 1/2 tspn pepper in a small bowl. Brush both sides of tri-tip with oil and sprinkle with powder, pressing to adhere. Grill tri-tips 5 minutes per side. Reduce heat to med-low, or move meat to cooler side of grill. Cover and grill until 130 degrees, brushing with BBQ sauce and turning every 10 minutes for about 30 more minutes.

Transfer to work surface, let stand 10 minutes. Cut meat crosswise into very thin slices; arrange on platter. Surround with carmelized onions and serve.
