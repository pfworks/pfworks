--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  onion -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded and chopped
  2                     serrano pepper -- seeded and stemmed, chopped
  3             pounds  boneless beef -- 1" cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  10            ounces  fresh tomatillos -- husked and diced
  3                     tomato -- chopped
  1                     bay leaf
     1/4      teaspoon  ground clove
  1           teaspoon  oregano
     3/4           cup  beef stock
  2              small  corn tortilla

Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add the onion, garlic and peppers. Cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Push the mixture to one side of the skillet and add the beef. Cook the meat, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Mix together the beef and onion mixture.

Add the remaining ingredients, except the tortillas, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for 2 hours.

Soak the tortillas in cold water for a few minutes. Squeeze the water out and finely crumble onto the beef. Stir in the crumbled tortillas into the beef and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove bay leaf before serving.
