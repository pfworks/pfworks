     1/4           cup  butter
  1                cup  minced onion
  1                cup  ketchup
     1/4           cup  molasses
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar -- packed
  1 1/2    tablespoons  worcestershire sauce
  2          teaspoons  yellow mustard
     3/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  chili powder
     1/4           cup  bourbon

  1 1/2      teaspoons  coarse kosher salt
  12                    chicken drumsticks

Melt butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; saute until soft, about 6 minutes. Add next 5 ingredients, 1/4 tspn black pepper, and chile powder. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Stir in burbon; cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.

Mix 1 1/2 tspns salt and 1/2 tspn pepper in bowl. Loosen skin on drumsticks. Rub salt and pepper mixture under skin without tearing skin. Cover; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.

Prepare BBQ. Grill drumsticks until skin is crisp and juices run clear, turning to cook all sides, about 25 minutes. Transfer 1/2 cup barbecue sauce to a small bowl; reserve. Brush drumsticks with remaining sauce and cook until glaze forms, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to platter and serve with reserved sauce.
