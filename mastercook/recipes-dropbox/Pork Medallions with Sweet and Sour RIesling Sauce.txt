  2                     pork tenderloins (each 12-16 oz) cut into 1 inch medallions
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
  7        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  onion -- thinly sliced
  1           teaspoon  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2           cup  sweet Riesling
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
     1/3           cup  golden raisins
  3        tablespoons  balsamic vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh thyme -- minced

Season both sides of the medallions with salt and pepper, and then dredge lightly in flour, shaking off the excess. Set aside. In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over med-high heat. Add the onions and cook until softened and just beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Add the farlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove to a plate. Add 1 more tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Add half the pork medallions and cook over med-high heat for 2 minutes or until browned. Turn and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove medallions to a plate and tent loosely with foil. Repeat with remaining medallions, butter and oil.

Return the onions to the skillet and add the Riesling, stick, raisins and vinegar. Increase the heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the liquid until lightly thickened. Return the medallions with juices to the skillet and heat to finish cooking, about 3 minutes. Remove the medallions to a warm platter, reduce the heat to medium, and stir in thyme and the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter. Salt, pepper and vinegar to taste. Pour sauce over medallions and serve.
