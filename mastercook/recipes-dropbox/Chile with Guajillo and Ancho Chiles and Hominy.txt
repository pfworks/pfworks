  8                     guajilli chiles
  2                     ancho chiles
  1                     dried new mexican chile
  4               cups  water
  1 1/2    tablespoons  cumin seed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  onion -- coarsely chopped
  8             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2             pounds  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
     1/2         pound  ground lamb
  28            ounces  can hominy
     1/4           cup  finely ground cornmeal
                        salt and pepper

Break open the chiles and discard the stems and seeds. In a medium saucepan, cover the chiles with water and bring to a boil. Cover the pan and remove from heat. Let stand, stirring a few times, until very soft, about 1 hour. Working in batches, puree the chiles with the soaking liquid in a blender.

Toast and grind cumin seeds. Use a big pot.

In the same pot, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook over med-high heat, stirring, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add beef, pork and lamb and cook, breaking up the meat into corase chunks, until starting to brown, about 10 minutes. Add cumin and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the chile puree and simmer over low heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Stir hominy and liquid into chili. Gradually stir in the cornmeal. Simmer, stirring, until thickened, 5 minutes. Season the chili with salt and pepper and serve.
