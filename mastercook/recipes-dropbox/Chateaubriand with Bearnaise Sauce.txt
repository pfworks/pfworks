                        Herb Rub
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  paprika
  1 1/2      teaspoons  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  lemon pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        steak
  2             pounds  boneless top sirloin or beef filet, 2 inches thick -- trimmed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
                        bearnaise sauce
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  shallot -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh tarragon -- chopped (or 1 tbspn dried)
                        salt and pepper
     1/2                juice of lemon
  3                     egg yolks -- lightly beaten
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- melted

Mix together herb rub. Rub meat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle herb mixture all over beef. Let stand for 15 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 400.

Coat the bottom of a large, heavy, ovenproof frying pan with the remaining olive oil and heat over high heat. Add the steak and sear on both sides until nicely browned. Transfer pan to oven and roast to desired doneness, 10-20 minutes longer. Transfer to carving board and let rest, loosely tented, while the sauce is being made.

Combine wine, vinegar, shallot, tarragon, and 1/2 tspn pepper in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook until reduced to 2/3, 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a heat proof bowl, stir in the lemon juice, and let cool. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (not touching). Whisk the egg yolks into the mixture. Heat gently over hot water, whisking contantly, until it begins to thicken, 2-3 mintues. Remove from heat and whisk in butter to form a thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper.

Sice the steak thinly on the diagonal across the grain and pass the sauce in a gravy boat.
