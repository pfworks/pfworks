  6                     chicken leg quarters (leg and thigh separated)
                        spice rub
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried marjoram
  2          teaspoons  onion powder
  2          teaspoons  garlic powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  3        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  black pepper
                        buttermilk brine
  2             quarts  buttermilk
  4        tablespoons  vinegar-based hot sauce
  6               cups  all-purpose flour
                        peanut oil or canola oil for frying
                        biscuits
                        butter for greasing
  2               cups  self-rising flour (low protein)
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  shortening
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
  1                cup  buttermilk (if not using low-protein flour, will take more)
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted

In a medium bowl, mix all of the rub ingredients. Add chicken and toss until well coated. Let stand at room temperature (if cooking within 4 hours) or refrigerated in a large bowl for an hour.

Pour enough buttermilk over the chicken to cover completely and stir in hot sauce. Leave on counter to 1-3 hours, or refrigerate for up to 24 hr. Pour legs onto colander and let excess drain.

In a large bowl, mix the flour with salt and pepper to season well. One by one add the chicken pieces, making sure they are thouroughly coated on all sides. Leave them in the bowl with excess flour while you wait on oil.

Head 4-6 inches of oil to 325. Knock off excess flour on chicken and drop in oil. Raise temp to 350 as chicken cooks. Cook 12-18 minutes until golden brown and at least 160. Remove to rack and season with salt. Cool a few minutes.

Preheat oven to 425 and arrange a shelf just under the center. Butter an 8 or 9 inch rounc cake pan or spray with cooking spray.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together self-rising flour, sugar and salt. Work the shortening in with your fingers until there are no large lumps. Gently stir in the cream, then some of the buttermilk until the dough resembles wet cottage cheese. 

Spread the plain all-purpose flour out on a plate or pie pan. With a medium ice cream scoop or spoon, place three or four scoops of dough well apart in the flour. Sprinkle flour over each. Flour hands. Turn a dough ball in the flour to coat, pick it up, and gently shape it into a round, shaking off excess flour as you work. Place this biscuit in the prepared pan. Coat each ball in the same way and place each scrunched up against its neighbor. Continue until all dough is used.

Place the pan in the oven. Bake until lightly browned, 20-25 minutes. Brush with melted butter. Invert onto plate, then back again on another. Cut quickly to separate and serve.
