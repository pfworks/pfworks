  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
     3/4           cup  unsalted butter -- diced, room temp
  4              large  eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  1                cup  walnuts -- chopped

  6             ounces  semisweet chocolate -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temp
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350. Butter 8x8x2 metal baking pan; dust with flour. Mix first 3 ingredients in a small bowl. Stir chocolate and butter in top of double boiler set over simmering water until melted and smooth. Turn off heat. Let stand over water.

Using electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar in large bowl until mixture thickens and falls in soft ribbon when beaters are lifted, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Stir in flour mixture in 2 additions, blending well after each. Gradually add warm chocolate to egg mixture, beating until just combined. Stir in walnuts.

Pour batter into pan. Bake brownies until top is set and tester comes out with moist crumbs attached, about 35 minutes. Cool completely in pan on rack.

For ganache: Whisk all in small saucepan over med-low heat until melted and smooth. Pour evenly over brownies in pan.

Chill until ganache is set, about 2 hours. Cut into 16 squares.
