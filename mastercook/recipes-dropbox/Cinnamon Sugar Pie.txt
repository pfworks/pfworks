                        Plain Pie Pastry -- prebaked
  3                     egg -- beaten
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1                cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground clove
  2               cups  half and half
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        Weepless Meringue

Combine the eggs, butter, sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in a saucepan and stir until thoroughly combined. Slowly pour in the half and half, stirring constantly. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, for about 25 minutes, until rich and smooth. Remove from heat and add vanilla.

Pour the filling into a shallow container, lay plastic wrap directly on the surface and chill in the refrigerator for about 2 hours, until cold.

Scrape filling into crust and return to fridge for 2-3 hours.

Preheat oven to 325.

Top the pie with the meringue, sealing the edges well.

Bake for 20 minutes, just until meringue is lightly browned. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     2/3           cup  vegetable shortening
  7        tablespoons  cold whole milk

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender until it is the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the milk over part of the flour mixture. Gently toss with a fork and push to the side. Sprinkle another over another dry part, toss and push to the side. Repeat until all the flour mixture is moistened.

Press the dough together to form 2 balls, then flatten into disks. Roll out the crusts right away, or wrap the dough tightly, smoothing out wrinkles or air pockets and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to a thickness of 1/8". Use a light touch and handle the dough as little as possible.

To prebake, preheat oven to 400. Press one rolled out crust into a 9 or 10 inch pie plate. Line with parchment paper and weigh down with beans or pie weights. Bake for 10 minutes. Take out of oven and carefully remove the weights. Place back in oven. Remove after 10 to 20 minutes, when it starts to turn golden to parbake. To fully bake continue for another 10-15 minutes until golden brown.

Yield:
  "2 9" crusts"

  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  8        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  hot water
  3                     egg whites -- room temperature
  1              pinch  salt

In a saucepan, stir together cornstarch, 2 tablespoons sugar, and enough of the hot water to make a smooth paste. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened and clear. Set aside to cool.

Combine the egg whites and salt in a chilled bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until soft peaks form. Add the cooled cornstarch mixture, and then the remaining 6 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat until the whites form stiff peaks but aren't dry.
