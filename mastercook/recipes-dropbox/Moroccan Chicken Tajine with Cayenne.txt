--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  chicken -- cut into serving pieces
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  4          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  ground ginger
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  ground turmeric
  2               cups  water
  1                cup  dried apricot halves -- soaked in water to cover until soft
  1                cup  whole blanched almonds
  2        tablespoons  butter

In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the chicken pieces in olive oil, about 5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a dish and pour off all but a few tablespoons of the oil.

Add the onion to the skillet over medium-high heat and cook, stirring, until browned, about 5 minutes. Add the spices and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add the water and bring to a boil.

Reduce the heat to med-low, add the chicken pieces and drained apricots, and simmer for 30 minutes, turning the chicken frequently, until the chicken is very tender and starts to fall from the bone. Add more water if necessary.

In another skillet, when the chicken is almost done, over medium heat, brown the almonds in the butter, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove almonds with slotted spoon.

To server, arrange the chicken on a platter, top with the sauce, and garnish with the almonds.
