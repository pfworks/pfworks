--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        dough
  2 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  2               cups  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  instant or rapid rise yeast
  1 2/3           cups  ice water
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2 1/4    tablespoons  salt
                        Sauce
  28            ounces  whole tomatoes -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
                        Pizza
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  2             ounces  parmesan cheese -- grated (1 cup)
  12            ounces  whole milk mozzarella cheese -- shredded (3 cups)

Using stand mixer with dough hook, mix flour, semolna flour, sugar and yeast on low speed until combined, about 10 seconds. With machine running, slowly add water and oil until dough forms and no dry flour remains, 1-2 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 10 minutes.

Add salt to dough and mix on medium speed until it forms a satiny, sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 6-8 minutes. Remove and knead briefly on lightly floured surface until smooth, about 1 minute. SHape into tight ball and place in a large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

Process tomatoes, sugar and salt in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Heat oil and garlic in medium saucepan over med-low heat, stirring, until fragrant and just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato mixture and cook, stirring until reduced to 2 cups, about 25-30 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, let cool.

One hour before baking pizza, place stone on upper middle rack and heat oven to 500. Spray rimmed baking sheet (including rim) with vege oil, then coat bottom with oil. Remove dough from fridge and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Lightly flour and press into 9x12 rectangle. Roll into 18x13 rectangle. Transfer to baking sheet, fitting dough into corners. Spray top with vege oil and place plastic wrap over. Place second sheet over dough and let sit 1 hour.

Remove top sheet and plastic wrap, gently lift and stretch dough to fill sheet. Spread sauce evenly over dough, leaving 1/2" border. Sprinkle parmesan evenly followed by mozarella.

Place pizza on stone; reduce oven to 450 and bake until bottom crust is evenly browned and cheese is bubbly and browned, 20-25 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove from oven and let cool on wire rack for 5 minutes. Run knofe around rim to loosen. Transfer to cutting board, cut into squares and serve.
