                        vegetable oil
  12                    corn tortilla
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  1              small  white onion -- chopped
  2              large  tomatoes -- boiled 30 sec, peeled and pureed for 2 cups
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  4 1/2           cups  zucchini -- chopped (3 zuccini)
  1 1/2           cups  fresh corn
  3                     poblano pepper -- charred, seeded and chopped
                        kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
                        nonstick cooking spray
  3               cups  oaxaca or monterey jack cheese -- shredded
     3/4           cup  crema or creme fraiche

Preheat oven to 350.

In a large, heavy saute pan, add enough oil to come 2 inches up side of pan. Heat on med-high heat. Quickly fry tortillas for about 10 seconds on each side. Remove and drain on paper towels.

In a medium saute pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and add the garlic and onion. Saute until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato puree. Cook for 10 minutes and turn the heat off.

In a separate large saute pan over med heat, melt the butter. Add the zuccini and corn. Cook for 2 minutes, and then add the chopped poblanos. Add 1/2 cup water and cook for 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Spray a 9x13 baking dish with spray. Cover the bottom with 4 tortillas. Add 1/2 cup of tomato mixture, 1.5 cups of zuccini mixture and 1 cup of cheese. Drizzle with 1/4 cup crema. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Repeat 2 more times. Place in oven until cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.
