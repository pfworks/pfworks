  14 1/2        ounces  whole tomatoes in juice -- drained
  2               cups  queso fresco -- crumbled
                        dough
  2               cups  freshly ground corn masa dough or mix 1.75 masa harina with 1 cup plus 2 tbspns warm water
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour

     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        warm water
                        vegetable oil (for frying)

For filling: Char chiles directly over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in paper bag for 10 minutes. Peel, seed and slice into 1/4" strips.

Place tomatoes in processor; chop coarsely. Heat oil in large saucepan over med-high heat. Add tomatoes and cook 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add chiles; cook until mixture thickens, stirring often, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; mix in cheese. Season with salt.

Dough: Combine masa, flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Knead to blend well, adding warm water by tablespoonfuls as needed until dough is soft but not sticky. Divide dough into 10 equal portions; roll each into ball. Place balls on sheet of aluminum foil. Cover balls of dough with plastic wrap to prevent dryhing.

Cut two 8 inch rounds from heavy duty resealable plastic bag. Place 1 round on bottom of tortilla press. Place 1 dough ball in center; top with second plastic round. Close press, gently flattenig dough to 4 inch round about 1/4 inch thick. Peel off top plastic. Lift bottom plastic and peel dough round off. Place on sheet of waxed paper. Shape remaining 9 balls into 4 inch rounds.

Line baking sheet with foil. Heat heavy large griddle or skillet over medium heat. Place two 4 inch rounds at a time on griddle or skillet. Cook until just light brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.

Pour enough oil into heavy large skillet to reach depth of 1/2 inch. Attach thermometer and heat oil to 325 to 350. Fry 2-3 at a time until crisp and lightly puffed, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to paper towels to drain.

Cut halfway around edge to make opening. Squeeze to open and spoon about 1/4 cup of filling into each one.
