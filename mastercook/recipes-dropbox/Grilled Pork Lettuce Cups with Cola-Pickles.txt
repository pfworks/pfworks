--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless country style pork ribs
  6        tablespoons  gochujang (korean fermented red chile paste)
  4             cloves  garlic
     3/4          inch  fresh ginger root -- peeled and sliced
  3        tablespoons  mirin (japanese sweet rice wine)
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  2          teaspoons  sesame oil
  16                    butter lettuce cups (about 2 heads)
                        pickles
  1 1/2           cups  cola
     1/2           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  chili garlic sauce
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  lime juice
  2                     red onion -- halved and sliced lengthwise

Pork: In a blender, combine red chile paste, garlic, ginger, mirin, soy sauce and sesame oil then puree. Place pork in resealable bag, add marinade, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours.

In a medium saucepan over high heat, combine cola, soy sauce and chili garlic sauce. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat to avoid boiling over, until reduced to 3/4 cup, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar and lime juice. Place onions in a medium bowl and stir in cola mixture. Set aside at room temperature for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Put in refrigerator if pickling longer.

Prepare grill and lightly oil grate. Remove pork from marinade and grill to 145, 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from grill and let rest 3 minutes.

To serve, thinly slice pork, arrange on lettuce leaves, and top with loosely drained pickled onions.
