  2              heads  garlic -- top third cut off
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  4             pounds  chicken -- cut in half lengthwise, backbone removed
     1/4           cup  Za'atar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon zest
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh rosemary
  1              small  serrano pepper -- seeded and minced
  2          teaspoons  dried marjoram
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
                        cumin aioli

Preheat oven to 400. Put garlic on a large sheet of foil. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and wrap tightly with foil. Roast until tender and golden brown, 45-50 minutes. Let cool.

Place chicken in a 13x9x2 glass baking dish. Sprinkle 2.5 tablespoons za'atar over chicken. Squeeze roasted garlic cloves out of skins and into a small bowl; mash into a paste with the back of a fork. Add 4 tablespoons oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, rosemary, chile and marjoram; whisk to blend. Pour over chicken; turn to coat. Cover; chill overnight.

Season chicken with salt and pepper. Let stand at room temperature 30 mintues. Meanwhile, build a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to med-high. Brush grill rack with remaining oil. Grill chicken, turning occasionally, until skin is crisp and browned and an instand read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of thigh without touching bone reads 160, about 35 mintues. Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoon za'atar, and let rest 10 minutes.

Cut each chicken half into 4 pieces and serve on a platter with cumin aioli.
