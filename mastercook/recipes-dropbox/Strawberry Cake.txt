--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  white sugar
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pound  strawberries -- cleaned, hulled and halved
  2        tablespoons  vanilla sugar

Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9 inch pie plate and set aside. In a medium bowl, beat the butter and sugar on med-high until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce to med-low and add the egg, milk and vanilla. Reduce to low and gradually mix in the flour mixture. Pour the batter into the pie plate. Arrange the strawberries on top, cut sides down, as close as possible. Sprinkle vanilla sugar on top of the berries. Bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Reduce to 325 and bake for an hour, until golden brown and firm to the touch. Let cool in plate and cut in wedges. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.
