  3               cups  frozen corn kernels -- thawed
     1/2           cup  whipping cream -- room temp
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  mascarpone cheese -- room temp
  1                cup  Pecorino Romano -- finely grated
     1/2           cup  Pecorino Romano -- finely grated
  1              large  lemon -- zested
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     3/4           cup  basil leaf -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  provolone cheese -- shredded
                        extra virgin olive oil

Arrange oven rack in center of oven. Preheat to 375. Butter 6 ramekins.



Bring a large pot of salted water to boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Drain. Using 2 cooked noodles in an X shape, line each ramekin, pushing noodles gently into the bottom, allowing to overhang.

In a food processor, blend the corn, cream, and garlic until chunky. Add the mascarpone, 1 cup of the Pecorino Romano cheese ,the lemon zest, salt and pepper, Blend until smooth. Add the basil and pulse until just combined. Spoon 1/4 cup of the filling into the bottom of each ramekin and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of Provolone. Fold 2 pieces of pasta over the filling, and trim if neccessary.  Add another 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons provolone. Fold remaining 2 noodles.

Spoon any remaining filling on top. Sprinkle tops with 1/2 cup Pecorino and drizzle with oil. Arrange ramekins on baking sheet and bake until tops are golden brown and filling is bubbling, about 25-30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes.
