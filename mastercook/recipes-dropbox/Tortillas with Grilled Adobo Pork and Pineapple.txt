  2        tablespoons  honey
  1         tablespoon  cilantro -- coarsely chopped
                        corn tortillas
  2               cups  instant corn masa mix for tortillas

Make adobo: Remove stems, seeds and membranes from chiles, then break into large pieces and set aside.

In a 4 qt saucepan over moderate heat, heat oil until hot. Add onion garlic, cloves, cinnamon, peppercorns, and cumin seeds and cook until onion is soft and golden brown, about 6 minutes. Add chiles and cook until darkened on both sides, about 1 minute.

Add enough water to cover mixture halfway and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced by half, 5-8 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain, discarding solids.

Make Pork: In re-sealable, 1-gallon, plastic bag, place 1/2 cup adobo sauce, orange juice, vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper. Add pork, seal, and chill at least 2 hours and not more than 6.

Preheat grill or broiler.

Remove pork and discard marinade. Grill or broil pork about 6 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until 145, about 25 minutes. Let stand, loosely covered in foil, 10 minutes. Chop pork into small dice and place in medium saucepan. Add 1/4 cup adobo and keep warm over low heat.

Grill or broil pineapple until it starts to get soft, 3-5 minutes. Place in bowl and let cool. Chop into small dice and return to bowl. Add oil, onion, cilantro, and lemon juice and stir. Set aside.

Puree oil and chives until smooth. Set aside.

Make tomatillo sauce: In a 10 inch skillet over moderate heat, heat oil until hot. Add tomatillos and onions and cook until lightly browned and soft, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, chiles, salt, and pepper and cook until garlic is light brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat, and add 1-2 tablespoons of honey if bitter.

Transfer to blender, add cilantro, and puree until smooth. Season with salt and peper and set aside.

Make tortillas: In a medium bowl, mix together masa and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons lukewarm water. Knead in bow until soft dough forms, adding more water if dry. Shape into 16 small balls, and cover with kitchen towe. 

Heat griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Lay plastic wrap or wax paper on bottom of tortilla press. Place dough on center, cover with plastic wrap or wax paper and lower top plate. You should have a 5-6" tortilla about 1/8" thick. Peel off wraps. Lay on cooler part of griddle. Let sit until released, 10-15 seconds. Flip tortilla to hotter part, and let cook until brown spots on bottom, 30-40 seconds. Flip over and cook another 30 seconds. Transfer to clean kitchen towel and cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat, cooking 2 at a time.

Transfer pork to pineapple to platter, and place tomatillo sauce and chive oil in small bowls. Serve with tortillas.
