                        Filling
  2             slices  bacon -- coarsely chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  Ground lean pork
  2             medium  onion -- finely chopped
     1/2                red bell pepper -- seeded and finely chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  powdered sage
                        salt and pepper
  1 1/2           cups  beef broth
                        Crust
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  butter -- chilled and cut into pieces
     1/2           cup  milk
  1         tablespoon  butter -- melted

Grease a 9" pie dish.



To make filling, fry bacon in a large skillet over medium heat till half cooked, break up pork in skillet, add the onions, bell pepper, garlic, sage, and salt and pepper, and stir till pork loses all pink color and the vegetables are soft, about 8 minutes. Add the broth, stir till slightly thickened, about 10 minutes, and remove from the heat.

Preheat oven to 425.

To make the crust, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and 6 tablespoons butter in a bowl and work the mixture with your fingers till mealy. Add the milk and stir just till the dough gathers into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 8-10 times, divide in half, and roll out one half with a floured rolling pin into a 12" circle. Fit the dough into the pie dish, pressing bottom and sides, then spoon the pork filling into the dish. Roll out remaining dough into a 12" circle, drape it over the filling, trim and pinch together the edges, and cut several vents in top. Brush top with melted butter and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and continue baking till golden, 30-35 minutes.
