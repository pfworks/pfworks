--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  mint leaf -- lightly packed
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  6             cloves  garlic -- roughly chopped
  1         tablespoon  black pepper
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  smoked paprika
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  lime juice
     1/4           cup  lime juice
  1           teaspoon  habanero chile -- minced
  4             pounds  whole chicken

Process everything except chicken in blender until smooth paste forms, 10-20 seconds. Using finger or handle of wooden spoon, trim skin over thighs and breast and remove any excess fat. Rub half of paste under skin. Spread the rest on outside. Tuck wingtips underneath. Place in ziploc bag and refrigerate for 6-24 hours.

Adjust rack to lowest position and heat oven to 325. Place vertical roaster on rimmed baking sheet. Slide chicken onto roaster until chicken stands upright and breast is perpendicular to bottom of pan. Roast until skin begons to turn golden and breast registers 140, 45-55 minutes. Remove chicken and increase temperature to 500.

Place 1 cup water in bottom of pan and return to oven. Roast until browned and crisp and 160 in breast and 175 in thigh, about 20 minutes. Rotate halfway through.

Remove from oven and let rest on roaster for 20 minutes. Lift chicken off roaster onto platter or cutting board. Carve chicken and serve with a spicy sauce.
