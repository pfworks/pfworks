--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
  1                cup  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1              large  egg -- room temperature
  2              large  egg yolks -- room temperature
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        frosting
  1                cup  heavy cream

Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 350. Line muffin/cupcake tin with liners.

Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in bowl of standing mixer with paddle attachment. Add butter, sour cream, egg and egg yolks, and vanilla; beat at medium speed until smooth and satiny, about 30 seconds. Scrape down and mix until no flour pockets remain.

Divide batter evenly among cups using heaping tablespoon. Bake until cupcake tops are pale gold and toothpick comes out clean, 20-24 minutes. Transfer to wire rack; let cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes.



Bring cream to boil in small saucepan. Place chocolate in medium bowl and pour boiling cream over. Cover with foil and let stand 5 minutes.Whisk until smooth, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until cool and slightly firm, 45 minutes to one hour.

Transfer cooled frosting to bowl of standing mixer fitted with whisk; whip at medium speed until fluffy and mousse-like forms medium-stiff peaks, about 2 minutes.

Spread 2-3 generous tablespoons frosting on each cupcake.
