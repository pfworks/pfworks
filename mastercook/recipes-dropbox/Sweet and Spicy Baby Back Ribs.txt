--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             cloves  garlic -- unpeeled
  6                     dried ancho pepper -- stemmed and seeded
  8                     dried new mexican or guajillo chiles -- stemmed and seeded
     3/4           cup  broth
  2        tablespoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo
  2          teaspoons  dried mexican oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  toasted ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  1           teaspoon  Santa Fe Sweet Spices or 1 tspn ground canela and a pinch of clove and allspice
     1/8           cup  apple cider vinegar
  6             pounds  baby back pork ribs
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar

For the marinade: Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat and roast the garlic, turning occasionally until blackened and soft, about 10 minutes. Cool and peel.

Raise the heat slightly on the skillet and toast the chiles on the hot surface, pressing with a metal spatula until they start to crackle, then turn them and toast the other side. Be careful not to burn the chiles. Place the chiles in a small bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes, drain and discard the water.

Blend the chiles along with the broth, chipotle, oregano, cumin, black pepper and Sweet Spice. Add vinegar. Add more liquid as needed to make a smooth puree. Strain into a bowl and add salt and brown sugar to taste.

For the ribs: Place the ribs in a large roasting pan and paint them with half the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Add the brown sugar to the remaining marinade, cover with tin foil and refrigerate for several hours.

Preheat the oven to 350. Uncover ribs and add water or broth to a depth of about 1/4" and replace the foil. Bake for approximately 45 minutes. Uncover and return the ribs to the oven for an additional 30 minutes. Skim the fat and pour off any excess liquid.

To glaze, raise the oven temperature to 450 or heat a grill. Brush the ribs heavily with the remaining marinade and bake until they are a deep red color, about 20 minutes. Boil any excess marinade and serve with the ribs.
