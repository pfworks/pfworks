Combine essence ingredients together.

Combine the flour and oil in a cast iron skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until a roux is formed that is the color of peanut butter.Transfer roux to a small bowl and set aside. In the same skillet, cook the ground beef and pork over medium high heat until well browned, about 8-10 minutes. Add the onions, bell peppers, celery, Essence, 1/2 tspn salt, 1/4 tspn black pepper, and the cayenne pepper and cook until veges are soft, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the roux and 1.5 cups water and stir well to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Add the crumbled cornbread, green onions and parsley, and stir well to combine.

Prehaet the broiler to high.

Using a sharp, thin knife, cut a pocket in the brisket from the thin side of the meat. Be careful not to pierce the 3 sides, the top or the bottom. Season the meat on both sides as well as inside the pocket with the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt and 1.25 tspns of pepper. Carefully stuff the brisket with the meat and cornbread mixture, reserving 2/3 cup of the stuffing on the side. Sew the open side of the brisket. Rub the vegetable oil on both sides of the brisket. Place brisket in dutch oven and broil until golden brown on both sides, about 15 minutes. Add the beer and reserved stuffing to the Dutch oven and cover the pan.

Reduce oven to 300 and cook for 2 hours. Uncover the pan and trim the brisket. Bake the brisket, covered, for 2 hours longer.

Remove brisket from Dutch oven and set aside, lightly covered with foil, to rest for 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce drippings to a gravy consistency, Serve with pan juices.
