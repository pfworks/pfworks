--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  blanched almond
  1               head  broccoli -- 1.5" pieces
                        freshly ground black pepper
  12            ounces  bucatini
  2             cloves  garlic
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  1                cup  fresh basil -- lightly packed
  28            ounces  whole san marzano tomatoes

Preheat oven to 450. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Put 2 pieces of foil side by side on a baking sheet. Put the almonds on one piece of foil and the broccoli on the other. Transfer to the oven; roast until the almonds are lightly toasted, about 7 minutes. Remove the foil with the almonds. Continue roasting the broccoli until tender, about 7 more minutes. Season the broccoli with salt and pepper and transfer to a large bowl.

Cook pasta.

Pulse almonds in a food processor until finely chopped; with the motor running, add the garlic and process until finely chopped. Drizzle in the olive oil and process until blended. Add the basil and pulse until smooth; transfer to bowl with broccoli.

Put the tomatoes and half the juice in the food processor and pulse until pureed. Add to the bowl with the broccoli and stir to combine. Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Drain the pasta and toss with the sauce.
