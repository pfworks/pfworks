--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed, seeded and soaked
  2          teaspoons  crumbled dried marjoram
  2          teaspoons  crumbled dried oregano
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled
  1              small  white onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  sweetened pineapple juice
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/3      teaspoon  ground pepper
  2             pounds  extra lean ground pork
                        vegetable oil
  1                     pineapple -- peeled, cored and sliced into 1/2" rounds
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
  8                     sesame seed hamburger buns
  1                cup  cilantro

Drain the soaked chiles and put them in a blender with the marjoram, oregano, garlic, 1/4 of the onion and the pineapple juice and puree until smooth. Add the salt and pepper.

Put the pork in a large bowl and pour the marinade on top. Using a fork, mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.

Divide the pork mixture into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a 1/2" thick patty.

Oil the grill pan. Working in batches, grill the burgers until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Let rest for 8 minutes.

Meanwhile brush the grill pan with oil and grill the pineapple slices until golden brown, 2 minutes per side.

Spread 1 tspn mayo on the cut sides of each bun and warm on the grill pan about 2 minutes, cut side down.

Place burgers onto the bottom half of the bun. Top with a slice of grilled pineapple, some cilantro and the remaining chopped onion. Cover with the bun tops and serve.
