                        soup
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  italian sausage
  3               cups  onion -- chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2        Tablespoons  tomato paste
  28            ounces  fire roasted diced tomatoes
  2                     bay leaves
  6               cups  chicken stock
  8             ounces  mafalda or fusilli pasta
     1/2           cup  basil leaf -- chopped
                        salt and pepper
                        cheesy yum
  8             ounces  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
                        black pepper
  2               cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add sausage, breaking into bite sized pieces, and brown for about 5 minutes. Add onions and cook until softened, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Cook for 1 minute. Add tomato paste and stir well. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until paste turns rusty brown.

Add diced tomatoes, bay leaves, and chicken stock. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Add uncooked pasta and cook until al dente. Do not overcook. Right before serving, stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.

While pasta is cooking, combine ricotta, parmesan, salt and pepper.

Place a dollop of the ricotta mixture in each bowl, sprinkle mozzarella on top, and ladle hot soup over cheese.
