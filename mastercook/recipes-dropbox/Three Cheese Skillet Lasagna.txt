  43            ounces  canned whole peeled plum tomatoes
  3             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
                        salt and pepper
  1              large  egg yolk
  1 1/2           cups  part-skim ricotta cheese -- room temperature
  12            ounces  no-boil lasagna noodles
     1/2         pound  fresh mozzarella -- shredded
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated

Preheat oven to 400. In a food processor, pulse tomatoes until coarsely pureed. In a large deep skillet, bring tomatoes, garlic, and oil to a boil. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce to a simeer and cook on medium until thickened, about 12 minutes.

Mix together egg yolk, ricotta, and 1/2 tspn salt and pepper in a medium bowl.

Carefully pour sauce into a heatproof bowl and return 3/4 cup to skillet; spread sauce evenly. Add a single layer of noodles, breaking them up to fit. Top with half the ricotta mixture, spreading evenly. Follow with a second layer of noodles, then 1.5 cups marinara. Add third layer of noodles, then remaining ricotta. Follow with a final noodle layer, then remaining sauce. Sprinkle mozzarella and parmesan on top.

Bake lasagna until golden and bubbling, 30-35 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.
