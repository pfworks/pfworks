  8             slices  bacon
     1/2    tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
                        glaze
     1/2           cup  ketchup
  2        tablespoons  molasses
     1/4           cup  dr pepper
  1         tablespoon  cracked black peppercorns

Beat egg and cream together.

Tear bread into small pieces and soak in milk mixture.

Pulse garlic, onion, bell pepper, and thyme in food processor until minced but not pureed.

Add milk/bread mixture, spices and hot sauce, pulse twice.

Combine meats with mixture and gently mix.

Form a "loaf". Wrap in plastic and put in fridge.

For the glaze, combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer for 5-8 minutes.

Preheat grill or oven to 325. Heat only one side of grill.

Render bacon about halfway, so it is still pliable.

Sear meatloaf on all sides, about 3 minutes per side, then move to cold side of grill and shingle with bacon. Spoon glaze over and close lid.

Cook for 15 minutes, and spoon more glaze. Close lid.

Cook for about 30 minutes longer, until 155.
