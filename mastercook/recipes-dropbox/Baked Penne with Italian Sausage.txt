--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  penne pasta
  1              pound  italian sausage
  1                cup  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  white wine
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
  15            ounces  tomato sauce
  15            ounces  diced tomatoes with garlic
  6             ounces  tomato paste
  2               cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Preheat oven to 350. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8-10 minutes or until al dente. Drain.

Place sausage and onion in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain excess fat. Pour in wine and cook for 1 minute, stirring, to deglaze the pan. Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toss with cooked pasta and place in a 9x13 baking dish. Cover with cheese.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
