                        sauce
  8             ounces  tomato sauce
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
                        cheese
  2               cups  white american cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  monterey jack cheese -- shredded
  3              drops  liquid smoke flavoring
                        dough
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Make sauce: Whisk together tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, sugar and oregano in a small bowl; set aside. Toss cheese with liquid smoke in medium bowl; set aside.

Mix dough: Combine flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Combine water and olive oil in measuring cup. Stir water mixture into flour until dough starts to come together. Turn dough over lightly floured surface and knead 3 or 4 times, until cohesive.

Adjust oven rack to lower middle position, place pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 475F. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time, press into small circle and transfer to parchment paper dusted lightly with flour. Using rolling pin, roll and stretch dough to form a 12 inch circle, rotating parchment as needed. Lift pizza and parchment off work surface onto inverted baking sheet.

Top each piece of dough with half of sauce and half of cheese. Carefully pull pizza and parchment off of baking sheet onto stone. Bake until underside is golden brown and cheese is melted, 9-12 minutes. Transfer pizza to cooling rack and let cool a few minutes. Cut into 2" squares.
