--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  dijon mustard
  1              large  onion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  honey
  3               cups  beer (not dark)
  3 1/2         pounds  boneless pork loin -- tied (3 - 3.5" wide)
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour

In a large saucepan stir together marinade ingredients. Bring marinade just to a boil, stirring and remove pan from the heat. In a blender puree marinade in 2 batches, transferring to aa bowl. Cool to room temp and spoon off foam.

In a large, heavy resealable plastic bag combine pork and marinade and seal bag, pressing out excess air. Put bag in a baking pan and marinate pork, chilled, turning once or twice, at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Let pork in marinade come to room temperature, about 40 minutes. Transfer marinade to a saucepan and bring to a boil.

Preheat oven to 375.

Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. In a flameproof roasting pan heat oil over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking and brown pork on all sides. Roast pork in middle of oven, basting frequently with some marinade, until a meat thermometer registers 155, 1 to 1.5 hours. Transfer to a cutting board, reserving juices in pan and discarding string and let stand, covered loosely with foil, about 15 minutes.

While pork is standing, skim and discard fat from pan and add remaining marinade. Deglaze roasting pan over moderately high heat, scraping up brown bits. Bring sauce just to a boil and strain through a fine sieve into another saucepan. Bring sauce to a simmer and whisk in beurre manie (flour and butter rubbed together), but by bit, whisking until sauce is combined well and thickened slightly.

Serve pork, sliced, with sauce.
