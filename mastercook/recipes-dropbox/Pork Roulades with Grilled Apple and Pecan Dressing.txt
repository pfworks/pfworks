Combine all essence ingredients.

Preheat oven to 400. In a saute pan, heat the olive oil. When the oil is hot, render the bacon until crispy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onions, celery, shallots, garlic, apples, pecans, parsley and sage. Season with salt and black pepper. Saute for 2-3 minutes. Stir in the cubed bread and chicken stock. Remove from the heat and cool completely. Makes 6 cups. Remove meat from the plastic wrap. Season pork with essence. Spread dressing evenly over the pork. Using butchers twine, tie the stuffed pork. Place pork on a roasting pan, seam side down. Season the outside with essence. ROast for 55 to 60 minutes, or until the meat is brown and juices run clear.
