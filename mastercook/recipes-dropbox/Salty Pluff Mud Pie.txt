--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  honey
  4 1/2    tablespoons  dark cocoa powder
  6        tablespoons  butter -- cubed
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  4                     egg
  1                     9" unbaked pie crust
  2        tablespoons  milk
                        flaky salt

Heat oven to 325. Combine honey, cocoa, butter and cream in a large, heavy bottom saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted and mixture is just starting to simmer.

Meanwhile, lightly beat 3 eggs in a medium bowl. Very slowly add 1/2 cup of hot honey mixture, whisking constantly. Pour tempered egg mixture back into pot, whisking contantly to keep eggs from scrambling. Continue to cook, stirring, until mixture is smooth and thick, 3 to 4 minutes; remove from heat.

Remove pie crust from refrigertor and flute edges. Whisk together remaining egg and milk until well combined. Brush egg wash over edge of pie dough, covering in and outs of fluting.

Pour filling into shell and lightly tap pie plate on the counter. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until no longer soupy. Allow pie to cool for at least 3 hours, then sprinkle with salt.
