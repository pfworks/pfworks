--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  Emeril's Creole Seasoning
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  tamari
     1/4           cup  mirin or dry sherry
     1/4           cup  green onion
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh ginger
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  minced hawaiian peppers or chile paste
  2                     1 lb ribeyes
  1         tablespoon  light brown sugar
  2                     maui onions -- peeled and cut into thick slices not separated
  1         tablespoon  crushed Szechwan peppercorns

In a bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients, except the maui onions, Essence, peppercorns and steaks.

Place the steaks in a large resealable bag with marinade. Seal and refrigerate for 12-36 hours.

Preheat grill.

Remove steaks from marinade and pat dry. Season both sides with 1 tablespoon of the Essence and the peppercorns. Pour marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Simmer until thickened and reduced by 1/3 in volume, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.

Sprinkle onions with remaining 1 tablespoon Essence.

Grill the steaks until med-rare, about 6 minutes per side. AT the same time, grill the onions (as though grilling a patty, so the rings stay together) until golden and char-marked by grill, turning once.

Remove steaks from grill and top with the grilled onions. Serve with the reduced marinade as sauce.
