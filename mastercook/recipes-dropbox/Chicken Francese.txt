--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     egg
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
  1                cup  flour
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil
  6              large  boneless skinless chicken breast -- sliced in half then into thin pieces
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1                     lemon -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  white wine
  1                     juice of lemon
  2               cups  chicken stock
  4        tablespoons  parsley -- minced

In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk eggs, milk, salt and pepper until blended. Place the flour in a separate bowl. Line a baking sheet with paper towels.

In a wide skillet, heat oils over medium heat until shimmering.

Lightly dredge the chicken in flour. Dip into egg batter and place in skillet. Fry, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to sheet and fry the rest.

When all cutlets are browned, remove  pan from heat and pour off the oil. Wipe out pan. Return to low heat.

Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter and scatter lemon slices over bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lemon slices are golden and browning around the edges, about 3 minutes. Scoop out lemon and set aside.

Add 3 tablespoons of butter, the wine and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Boil until syrupy, 3-4 minutes. Pour in stock, bring to a boil and cook until thickened into a sauce, about 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings.

Reduce heat, tuck chicken in pan and simmer gently until sauce is velvety and chicken is heated though, about 4 minutes. Place lemon on top. Sprinkle with parsley. Spoon sauce over each serving.
