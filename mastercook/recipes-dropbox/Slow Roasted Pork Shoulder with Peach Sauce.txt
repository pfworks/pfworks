     1/3           cup  packed light brown sugar

                        peach sauce

For the sauce: Bring peaches, wine, sugar, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup jus, and thyme to simmer in small saucepan; cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 2 cups, about 30 minutes. Stir in remaining vinegar and mustard. Remove thyme, cover and keep warm.
