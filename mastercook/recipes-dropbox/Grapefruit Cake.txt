Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into mixing bowl. Make a well in center of dry ingredients. Add water, oil, egg yolks, grapefruit juice and lemon rind. Beat until smooth. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar separately, until whites are stiff, but not dry. Gradually pour egg yolk mixture over whites, folding gently with a rubber spatula until just blended. Do not stir. Pour into ungreased pan. Bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes, or until springy. Invert pan on rack until cool. Run spatula around edge and carefully remove. With a serrated knife, gently cut layer in half.

Let cream cheese soften to room temp then beat until fluffy. Add lemon juice and rind. Gradually blend in sugar. Beat until well blended. Add food coloring. Crush several grapefruit sections to measure 2 teaspoons. Blend into frosting. Spread frosting on bottom half of cake. Top with several grapefruit sections. Cover with second half of cake. Frost top and sides. Garnish with remaining grapfruit sections.
