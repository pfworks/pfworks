--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  blade, sirloin or round steak -- trimmed
  4                     6 inch sub rolls, split lengthwise
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     onions -- chopped
                        salt and pepper
  12            ounces  sliced provolone

Cut meat into 1 inch wide strips, freeze for about 25 minutes, and shave thin.

Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400. Spread split rolls on a baking sheet and toast lightly, 5-10 minutes.

Heat oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and saute until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the shaved meat, 1/2 tspn salt and 1/2 tspn pepper and continue to cook until the beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.

Turn the heat to low, shingle the cheese over the meat, and allow to melt, about 1 minute. Fold the cheese into the meat. Serve on the rolls.
