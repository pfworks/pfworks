--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     3/4      teaspoon  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  vegetable shortening
     1/2           cup  buttermilk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla paste
                        canola oil

Combine the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar in a bowl. Cut in the shortening until a coarse meal is formed. Stir in the buttermilk and vanilla paste with a fork unti the mixture comes together into a moist dough. Form into a ball, knead several times, and cover; let rest for 30 minutes.

Heat the oil in a deep pot to 375. Roll out half the dough to 1/8" thickness and cut into squares or triangles. Drop the pieces of dough, one by one, into the hot oil and fry until golden, about 30 to 40 seconds, rolling them over to brown on both sides. Roll and cut remaining dough and fry. Drain on paper towels.
