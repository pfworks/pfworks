  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2              large  onion -- sliced

Cook bacon in oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat until lightly browned, 5-7 minutes. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring, over medium heat until very soft, about 10 minutes. Add pepperoncini, tomatoes and salt. Simmer, stirring occasionally and breaking up the tomatoes with a wooden spoon, until thick and saucy, about 1 hour, reducing the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer.
