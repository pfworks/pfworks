--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  rosemary
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  4                     filet mignon -- 1.5" thick
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        sauce
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1                     shallot -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh flat-leaf parsley -- minced
  2        tablespoons  cognac
  1         tablespoon  dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1                cup  beef stock
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        cayenne
                        salt and pepper

Mix rub ingredients in a small bowl. Sprinkle all over meat, reserving 1 tablespoon. Let the steaks stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to 1 hour.

In a large, heavy frying pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil. Add the steaks and cook to the desired doneness, turning once, 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and let rest, tented, while you make the pan sauce.

In the same pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot and parsley and saute until the shallot is softened, 2-3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the cognac. Briefly return to heat to warm; then remove from heat and ignite, making sure overhead fan is off. When flame has burned out, return pan to high heat and whisk in the mustard, tomato paste, 1 tbspn rub, and beef stock. Cook, whisking often, to reduce sauce by 1/2, 4-5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the cream and cayenne to taste. Add any juices from steaks and salt and pepper to taste.

Spoon sauce over steaks and serve.
