--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     bell pepper (red, yellow or orange) -- seeded and chopped
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/2           cup  yellow onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- chopped
  5               cups  water
  8             ounces  roasted, peeled green chiles
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 1/4           cups  half and half
     1/4      teaspoon  paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/8      teaspoon  cayenne
                        Flour Slurry
  1                cup  cold water
     1/2           cup  flour
                        Garnish
     1/2           cup  plain yogurt
  1                     lime -- cut into wedges

Saute peppers in a dry, preheated pan over medium heat until the skins start to blacken. Transfer to a heavy bottomed stockpot. Add olive oil, onion, and garlic, and cook until onions turn golden. Add water, followed by remaining soup ingredients. Just as it comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

Transfer to blender and blend until smooth. Return to pot and heat over low heat.

Mix cold water and flour in a jar, close tightly and shake well. Add to heated soup and cook for 10 minutes on medium heat, or until soup thickens and the flour is cooked.

Garnish each bowl with a dollop of yogurt and a lime wedge.
