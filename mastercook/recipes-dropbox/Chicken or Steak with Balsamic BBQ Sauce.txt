--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  balsamic vinegar
     3/4           cup  ketchup
     1/3           cup  brown sugar
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  dijon mustard
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  4             pieces  chicken or new york strip or club strip steak
                        salt and freshly ground pepper

Combine all sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and stir until smooth. Simmer over medium heat until reduced by 1/3, about 15 to 20 minutes.

Place a grill pan over medium heat or preheat a grill. Season meat with salt and pepper. Lightly coat with some of the BBQ sauce using a pastry brush. Place the meat on the grill. Place the remaining BBQ sauce, still in the small saucepan, over low heat or on the edge of grill to simmer while meat cooks.

Cook the chicken about 8 minutes per side. Cook the steaks about 4 minutes per side. Continuously brush meat with sauce every few minutes. Remove meat from grill and let rest 5 minutes. Serve with heated BBQ sauce.

Or, bake chicken. Preheat to 375. Place chicken skin side up in a baking dish and bake for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, spoon sauce over top. Return to oven for another 15 minutes.
