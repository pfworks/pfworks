  3        tablespoons  canola oil
  1              pound  rib eye steak
     3/4    tablespoon  kosher salt
     1/2    tablespoon  freshly ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2             sprigs  rosemary
  2             cloves  garlic -- smashed
  1                     baguette
  4        tablespoons  butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  chopped garlic
  2        tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- grated
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 350.

Slice the steak in half lengthwise then season all of the sides with the salt and pepper. Heat oil in a pan over very hgh heat until smoking.

Sear the steak for about 1 minute, then flip. Add the butter, rosemary, and garlic, swirling so butter melts. Tilt the pan towards you, and using a large spoon, constantly scoop the melted butter over steak, basting for about 1 minute. Sear sides of steak for about 30 seconds then remove from heat. Repeat with other steak.

Cut the ends off the baguette and remove insides using knife. Once the steak is cool, stuff the hollowed out baguettes with steak. Place on baking sheet.

In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, Parmesan, and parsley, stirring until evenly combined. Spread on top of the baguettes evenly. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Sluce into 1 inch slices and serve.
