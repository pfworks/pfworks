  1         tablespoon  italian seasoning
  1           teaspoon  fennel seed
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  onion powder
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
                        filling
  2 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     red bell pepper -- diced
  3                     sweet italian sausages
  24            slices  pepperoni
  2             ounces  cooked bacon -- diced
  2 1/2           cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese
  2              sheet  puff pastry -- thawed
  1                     egg white

Preheat oven to 375. That puff pastry on counter. When thawed, unfold and cover with a damp towel.

In a medium saucepan, combine all sauce ingredients and simmer on low for 15 minutes.

In a medium skillet, warm 2 tbspns oil over medium heat. Add pepper and saute until softened, about 7 minutes; remove from pan. Set aside. Turn heat to low and add remaining 1/2 tbsp of oil. Place sausages in pan and brown on all sides. When done, cut them lengthwise, then crosswise into a 1/2" dice.

In a large bowl, combine sauce, peppers, sausage, pepperoni, bacon, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese and mix well.

Fill ramekins to the top and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Place an empty ramekin on puff pastry and cut out a circle slightly larger than ramekin. Place on top of ramekin, pulling and stretching to fit over sides. Seal edges and brush with egg white. Cut slits into pastry.

Place ramekins on a cookie sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until sauce is bubbling and tops are golden brown.
