                        pork
  3                     1 lb pork tenderloins -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
                        kosher salt and pepper
                        Sauce
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              small  onion -- diced
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded and 1/2" diced
  1             medium  yellow bell pepper -- cored, seeded and 1/2" diced
  1             medium  orange bell pepper -- cored, seeded and 1/2" diced
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
                        kosher salt
                        black pepper
  1 1/4           cups  red wine such as syrah or a cab
  2 1/2    tablespoons  smoked paprika
  15            ounces  tomato puree
  1                     dried bay leaf
     1/4           cup  flat-leaf parsley -- chopped

Put an oven rack in the center of the ovem. Preheat oven to 400.

Rub 1 tablespon of the oil over the pork and season with salt and pepper, to taste. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over high heat. Add the pork and brown it on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer the pork to a 13x9x2 inch glass baking dish and roast it until an instant read thermometer reads 165, about 25-30 minutes. Allow the pork to rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board.

In the same skillet used for the pork, heat the oil over medium high heat. Add the onion, peppers and garlic and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook, stirring frequently until softened, about 8-10 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 2 minutes, scraping up brown bits. Stir in paprika, tomato puree and bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until sauce thickens, about 25-30 minutes. Remove bay leaf and put sauce in blender. Blend until smooth. Season with 2 tablespoons of salt and pepper, to taste.

Slice pork thinly and arrange on platter. Spoon sauce on top, garnish with chopped parsley and serve.
