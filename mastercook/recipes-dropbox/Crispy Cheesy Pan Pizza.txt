--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        crusty
  2               cups  flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  yeast
     3/4           cup  lukewarm water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
                        topping
  6             ounces  mozzarella cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  sauce
                        cheese and herbs

Place the flour, salt, yeast, water and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a stand mixer. Mix into a sticky mass with no dry patches, 30-45 seconds. Scrape down sides and put dough in ball. Cover bowl.

After 5 minutes, uncover bowl and reach a bowl scraper or wet hand into bowl. Stretch bottom of dough up and over top 4 times. Turn 90 degrees each time. 

Recover, and after 5 minutes repeat 3 times. Cover and let rest for 40 minutes. Then refrigerate for 12-72 hours.

About 3 hours prior to serving, prepare pan. Pour 1.5 tablespoons oil into 10" cast iron skillet. Spread all over and up edges.

Transfer dough to pan and turn it once to coat. Press to edges of pan, dimpling. Cover and let rest 15 minutes and spread again. Repeat once more if needed.

Cover and let rise for 2 hours.

About 30m prior to cooking, place one rack at bottom and one 4-5" from top element. Preheat to 450.

Sprinkle 3/4 of mozzarella evenly over crust. Cover the entire crust with no dough showing. Dollop spoonfuls of sauce over the cheese. Sprinkle with remaining mozzarella.

Bake for 18-20 minutes on bottom until cheese is bubbling and edges and bottom of crust are golden. Move to top for 2-4 minutes if not done on top and leave on bottom if bottom not done.

Remove from oven. Run a knife around edge. Cool briefly and remove to cutting surface. Cut and serve.
