                        cake
     3/4           cup  butter
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  all-purpose flour -- sifted
  2 3/4      teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4                     eggs
  2               cups  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
                        caramel icing
  1              pound  light brown sugar
     1/2           cup  butter
  7        tablespoons  evaporated milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325. Grease and flour 2 9 inch cake pans.

In a small saucepan, cook the butter and milk over low heat until the butter melts. Stir well and let cool to room temperature.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt.

Using an electric mixer, beat eggs and sugar on high speed until light yellow and smooth.

Stir flour mixture into the egg mixture just until combined.

Add the cooled milk mixture and vanilla and stir well.

Divide the batter between the two pans and bake 25-30 minutes.

Place pans on wire rack and let cool 10 minutes. Remove cake from pans and let cool completely on racks.

Make icing. In a medium saucepan with a heavy bottom, combine the brown sugar, butter, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Bring to boil over medium high heat. Stir well and turn heat down so mixture boils gently. Cook for 7 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.

Beat the icing with a wooden spoon for 2-3 minutes to thicken.

Place bottom layer on a platter or cake stand. Working quickly before icing sets up, spread icing on top. Place second second layer on top. Ice the top and sides. A knife tipped in hot water can help smooth the icing out.
