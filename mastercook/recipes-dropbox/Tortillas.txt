--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8               cups  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  salt
     1/2           cup  lard
  2 3/4           cups  warm water
     1/4           cup  lard

In large bowl, sift together flour and salt. Using hands, quickly blend the 1/2 cup lard into flour mixture. Gradually add warm water, mixing constantly, until soft dough (not sticky) is obtained. Turn out on floured board and knead 10 minutes. Pat lightly with some of the additional lard, cover with a dish towel and set aside to rest 5 minutes.

Divide dough into about 24 pieces the size of tennis balls. Pat each ball with lard, cover with waxed paper and let rest 30 minutes.

Now to shape them: Traditionally, the flour tortilla is patted out by hand; however, a rolling pin may be used. Flour the board generously and roll dough into circles about 6-8 inches in diameter - or larger and thinner if things are going well.

Meanwhile, heat the comal (or a large, heavy, well seasoned griddle) to very hot. (It is hot enough when drops of water sizzle instantly). Do *not* grease it.

Bake the tortillas on the comal, first one side, momentarily, until it bubbles slightly; then lift, flip and cook the other side.
