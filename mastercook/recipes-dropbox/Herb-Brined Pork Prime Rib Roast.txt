--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Brine
  6             quarts  cold water -- divided
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     3/4           cup  fine sea salt
  8              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  6                     Turkish bay leaves -- crumbled
  4                     juniper berries
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorn
                        pork
  6             pounds  center-cut pork rib roast (8 bone, 12-14 inches long) -- well-trimmed
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2          teaspoons  whole black peppercorn -- crushed

Combine 1 qt water and all remaining brine ingredients in medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar and salt dissolve. Pour brine into wide pot or container large enough to hold pork (3-4 gallons). Add remaining 5 qts of cold water; stir to blend. Let stand until brine is cool to touch, about 1 hour.

Place pork on work surface. Trim off all but 1/4" layer of fat from roast. Turn roast over so that rib bones point up. Using boning knife and starting where meat meets rib bones, gradually cut loin away from rack of bones, leaving 2 inches of meat attached to bones. (do not cut away meat completely). Tie meat back onto bones with kitchen string at 2 inch intervals. Place roast in brine, submerging pork completely and weighing down with heavy pot if necessary. Cover and refrigerate 5 days.

Remove pork from brine; discard brine. Rinse pork under cold running water for 5 minutes to reduce saltiness; pat dry with paper towels. Place pork on rack set over a sheet of foil; let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 400. Place pork on rack in large roasting pan. Mix thyme and crushed peppercorns in small bowl; sprinkle over pork. Roast until thermometer reads 140, about 1 hour. Remove from oven. Let roast rest 30 minutes.


Remove string, cut pork into slices and serve.
