--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  whole black peppercorn
  2        tablespoons  white onion -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  mayonnaise
     1/3           cup  sour cream
  2        tablespoons  whipping cream
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
  2             pounds  large asparagus spears -- trimmed

Place peppercorns in heavy resealable plastic bag; crush coarsely with mallet. Heat heavy small skillet over medium heat. Add peppercorns and onion. Cook until peppercorns are fragrant and toasted, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes. Whisk mayo, sour cream, whipping cream, and vinegar in a smal bowl to blend. Stir in peppercorn mixture. Season with salt.

Preheat broiler. Butter 13x9x2 inch glass baking dish or broilerproof casserole. Cook asparagus in a large pot of boiling water until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain well and pat dry. Arrange asparagus in single layer in prepared dish. Spread with sabayon. Broil until sauce turns golden, about 2 minutes.
