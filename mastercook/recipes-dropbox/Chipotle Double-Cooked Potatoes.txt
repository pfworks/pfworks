  3             medium  baking potato -- scrubbed
     1/2         pound  soft goat cheese
     1/2           cup  scallion -- thinly sliced
  2        tablespoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo -- pureed
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  milk
                        salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 350.

Bake potatoes for 1 hour, or until done. Let cool to room temp. When cool enough to handle, cut potatoes in half lengthwise and hollow out the potatoes, leaving shells whole and reserving. Mash the potato flesh with the goat cheese, scallions and chipotle puree.

In a small saucepan over med heat, melt the butter with the milk. Beat into the potato-cheese mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stuff the reserved shells with the potato mixture.

Heat oven to 400. Heat potatoes for 5 minutes until hot.
