  2             medium  onion -- peeled and halved through root end
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        meatballs
  1                cup  fresh breadcrumbs from crustless french or country style bread
     1/3           cup  whole milk
  8             ounces  ground beef
  8             ounces  ground pork
  1                cup  parmesan cheese -- finely grated
     1/3           cup  italian parsley -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
  2              large  egg
  2             cloves  garlic -- pressed
  1              pound  spaghetti
                        parmesan cheese -- freshly grated

Sauce: Combine tomatoes with juice, butter, onions and salt in a large, wide pot. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Discard onions. Using immersion blender, process briefly to break up tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.

Meatballs: Combine crumbs and milk in small bowl; stir until evenly moistened. Let stand 10 minutes.

Place beef and pork in a large bowl and break up into small chunks. Add 1 cup parmesan, parsley, salt and pepper.

Whisk eggs to blend in small bowl; whisk in garlic. Add to meat mixture.

Using hands, squeeze milk from crumbs, reserving milk. Add crumbs to meat. Using hands, quickly and gently mix until just combined. Chill mixture 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Moisten hands with some of reserved milk, then roll meat mixture into golfball sized balls. Arrange balls in single layer in sauce and bring to simmer.

Reduce to med-low, cover and simmer until meatballs are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.

Cook spaghetti.

Using slotted spoon, transfer meatballs to platter. Add pasta to sauce and toss to coat. Divide pasta among plates and top with meatballs. Sprinkle cheese on top.
