  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
     1/3           cup  balsamic vinegar
  1             bottle  dry red wine
  2                     turkish bay leaves or 1 CA
  2             sprigs  thyme
  3               cups  beef broth
  3               cups  water
  2 1/2         pounds  small white boiling potatoes
  1 1/2         pounds  carrot

Preheat oven to 350 with rack in middle.

Pat beef dry and season with 2.5 tspns salt and 1 tspn pepper.

Heat oil in pot over med-high heat until it shimmers, then brown meat, without crowding, in 3 batches, turning about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer to platter.

Reduce heat to med, then add carrots, celery, onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, about 12 minutes.

Push veges to one side of pot. Add tomato paste to cleared area and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, then stir into veges.

Add vinegar and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.

Stir in wine, bay leaves and thyme and boil until wine is reduced by about 2/3, 10-12 minutes.

Add broth to pot along with water, beef and any juices from platter and bring to a simmer. Cover and braise in oven until meat is very tender, about 2.5 hours.

Set a large colander in a large bowl. Pour stew into colander. Return pieces of meat to pot, then discard remaining solids. Let liquid stand 10 minutes.

While beef braises, peel potatoes and cut into 1/2 inch wedges. Slice carots diagonally. (1 inch)

Add potatoes and carrots to stew and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally until tender, about 40 minutes.
