  2             pounds  butt-end beef tenderloin roast -- well-trimmed
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped carrot
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1                cup  beef broth
     1/3           cup  Canadian whiskey
  1         tablespoon  all purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  butter -- room temp
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
  2          teaspoons  coarsely crushed black peppercorns

Preheat oven to 400. Pat tenderloin dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in heavy large ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add beef to skillet and cook until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Add chopped onions, carrots and thyme to skillet.

Transfer skillet to oven and roast beef until 120, stirring vegetables occasionally, about 30 minutes. Transfer beef to platter. Tent with foil to keep warm.

Place skillet with vegetables over med-high heat. Add canned beef broth and whisky and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits. Boil until liquid is reduced to 2/3 cup, stirring occasionally, about 7 minutes. Strain sauce and return to skillet.

Mix flour and butter in small bowl until smooth paste forms. Add to sauce in skillet and whisk until well blended. Add whipping cream, crushed peppercorns and any juices from beef. Simmer over medium heat until sauce thickens, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes. Season with salt.

Cut beef into thick slices and arrange on platter. Spoon sauce over.
