--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  jalapeno
  4             cloves  garlic -- papery outer layer still attached
  1               dash  cayenne
     1/2           cup  packed cilantro leaves
  3        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1                     lime -- zested
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh cracked black pepper
  2               cups  mayonnaise

Heat a skillet over high heat. Add the jalepeno and garlic to the dry skillet. Coom until blackened and charred on all sides, about 10 minutes. Place in a plastic bag, seal and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Then remove the stems, most of the skin and all of the seeds and ribs from the jalapeno, and the outer layer of the garlic. Add jalapenos and garlic to a food processor with remaining ingredients. Blend and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper and/or cayenne.
