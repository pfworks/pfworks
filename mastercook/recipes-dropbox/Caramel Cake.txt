  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  1              stick  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  2              large  egg -- room temp
  1                cup  buttermilk -- well-shaken
                        glaze
  1                cup  heavy cream

Preheat oven to 350 with rack in middle. Butter an 8 inch square cakee pan and line with a square of parchment paper, then butter parchment.

Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

Beat butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until pale and fluffy, then beat in vanilla. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. At low speed, beat in buttermilk until just combined. Add flour mixute in 3 batches, muxing until each addition is just incorporated.

Spread batter evenly in cake pan, then rap pan on counter several times to eliminate air bubbles. Bake until golden and clean toothipick, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool pan on a rack 10 minutes, then run knife around edge of pan. Invert onto rack and discard parchment. Cool completely, about 1 hour.

Bring cream, brown sugar, corn syrup and a pinch of salt to a boil in a 1.5 qt heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Boil until glaze registers 210-212, 12-14 minutes, then stir in vanilla.

Put rack with cake in a shallow baking pan and pour hot glaze over top of cake, allowing it to run down the sides. Cool until glaze is set, about 30 minutes.
