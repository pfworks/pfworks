--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2    tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2         small  white onion -- finely minced
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  dark soy sauce
  4        tablespoons  ancho chile puree
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
     2/3           cup  water
  4             ounces  dried apricot -- finely chopped
  4                     thick pork loin chops (about 1.5 lbs)
                        salt and pepper

Heat oil in a heavy, enameled saucepan and saute onion until translucent. Add garlic and cook about 1 minute. Add brown sugar, soy sauce, chile puree, wine, water, and apricots and bring to a simmer. Cook on low heat, stirring until the mixture is thick and the apricots are soft, 20-30 minutes. Season the chops with salt and pepper. Pour 1/2 the glaze over the pork chops in a small dish, and marinate in refrigerator for 2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven broiler, setting the rack about 7 inches below the flame. Broil the chops 8 minutes on each side, turning once, until done. Meanwhile, warm remaining glaze over a low flame. Serve the chops with remaining glaze on the side.
