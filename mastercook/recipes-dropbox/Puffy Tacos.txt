--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  corn masa mix
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2 1/4           cups  warm water
                        vegetable oil

Combine masa, salt and warm water in a large bowl and mix until a smooth dough forms. Pull off pieces of dough and roll them into balls about the size of a ping pong ball.

Cut a quart-sized resealable plastic bag open down both sides to form a rectangle. Use the bag to line the tortilla press. Use the press to make the tortilla.

Pour 2 inches of vegetable oil into a large, deep pot and heat to 350.

Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and, using a metal spatula, repeatedly douse the tortilla with the hot oil until it begins to puff up. Flip it overf and, using the spatula, make an indentation in the middle to form a taco shape. Transfer to paper twels to drain.
