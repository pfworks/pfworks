  1                     red bell pepper -- halved and seeded
  1                     orange bell pepper -- halved and seeded
                        olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1                cup  couscous
  2               cups  boiling water
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt

Preheat oven to 450. Coat peppers with oil and roast them for about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.

Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan and add the couscous. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat until you begin to smell it cooking. Add boiling water and salt, stirring as you go. Turn down heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes or until water has evaporated.

Slice the peppers into short, thin strips, about 1 inch long. Toss the peppers in with the couscous and a little extra butter, oil and/or salt.
