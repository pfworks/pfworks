  6             pounds  flat-cut brisket -- trimmed
  2        tablespoons  rendered bacon fat or olive oil
  4               cups  low-salt chicken broth
  12            ounces  porter or stout
  6                     whole pitted prunes
  4                     bay leaf
  2          teaspoons  dark brown sugar -- packed
  6               cups  onion -- thinly sliced
  8                     whole garlic cloves -- peeled
  1              pound  med carrots -- peeled and cut xwise into 1.5" lengths
  2        tablespoons  whole grain dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  malt vinegar

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350. Mix first 5 ingredients in small bowl. Rub herb mixture all over brisket. Heat bacon fat in heavy extra-large wide ovenproof pot over med-high heat. Add brisket to pot and cook until deep brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer brisket to platter or rimmed baking sheet. Add 2 cups broth to pot and bring to boil, scraping up bits. Stir in porter, prunes, bay leaves and brown sugar; bring to boil. Return brisket to pot, fat side down; scatter onion slices to cover meat then add garlic.

Cover pot; place in oven and braise brisket 1 hour. Remove pot from oven; uncover and turn brisket over so that onion slices fall in liquid. Return to oven and braise uncovered 30 minutes. Add 1 cup broth. Cover and bake 1.5 hours longer.

Transfer brisket to platter or rimmed baking sheet; add 1 more cup broth to liquid in pot, then add carrots. Return brisket to pot. Cover and return to oven; braise until meat and carrots are very tender, adding more broth by cupfuls, if needed, to cover veges, about 45 minutes longer. Cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled at least 1 day and up to 2 days.

Preheat oven to 350. Spoon off any fat from surface of brisket pan juices and discard. Transfer brisket to cutting board. Thinly slice brisket across grain. Place slices in large roasting pan. Bring pan juices with vegetables in pot to a boil. Whisk in mustard and 1 tbspn vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper, adding more vinegar if needed. Pour juices and vegetables over brisket in roasting pan. Cover pan tightly and cook in oven until heated through, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Serve meat with veges and sauce.
