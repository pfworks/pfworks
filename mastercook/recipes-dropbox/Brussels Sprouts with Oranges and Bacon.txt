--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2              small  oranges -- halved, then 1/2" slices
                        kosher salt
  4             strips  bacon (1 cup) -- 1/4" pieces
  1 1/2         pounds  brussels sprout -- trimmed and halved

Preheat oven to 425. Brush a rimmed baking sheet generously with oil. Add oranges, in a single layer, turning to coat. Season with salt and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Roast for 15 minutes. Add bacon and roast until crisp, about 12 minutes.

Toss brussels sprouts with remaining 4 tablespoons oil and season with salt. Add to baking sheet, toss to combine. Roast, tossing once, until sprouts are tender and browning at edges and oranges are deeply caramelized, 25-30 minutes more.
