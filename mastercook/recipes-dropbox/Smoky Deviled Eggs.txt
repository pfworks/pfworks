--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  eggs
  6             ounces  smoked chicken -- 1/2" diced
  4        tablespoons  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  3          teaspoons  tabasco sauce
  1               drop  liquid smoke flavoring
                        kosher salt
                        black pepper -- freshly ground
                        paprika

Hard cook the eggs. Place eggs in large pot and add cold water to cover by 2 inches. Gradually bring to boil over medium heat. Let eggs boil for exactly 11 minutes. Pour off boiling water and fill the pot with cold water, letting water run till eggs are cool enough to handle. Tap end of egg on work surface to crack shell, then shell it under cold running water. Repeat with remaining eggs. Let cool to room temp.

Cut a thin (1/8 ") slice off the top and bottom of each egg. Cut each egg in half lengthwise. Scoop out yolks with spoon.

Place the smoked chicken in a food processor and process until finely ground. Add egg yolks and process until a paste forms. Add the mayo, mustard w-sauce, tabasco and liquid smoke, and pulse a few times quickly to mix. If it is too dry (it should be like soft ice cream) add some more mayo. Season with salt and pepper.

Using a spoon or pastry bag eith an open star tip, stuff or pipe mixture into egg halves. Sprinkle each with paprika.
