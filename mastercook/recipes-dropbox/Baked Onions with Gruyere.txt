--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        vegetable oil cooking spray
  5             medium  Vidalia onion
  2          teaspoons  olive oil
                        salt and pepper
  1                cup  low-sodium beef broth
  2          teaspoons  low sodium soy sauce
  1                cup  Gruyere cheese -- finely shredded
  2          teaspoons  fresh sage -- finely chopped

Preheat oven to 400. Spray a large, shallow baking dish with spray. 

Cut about 1/4" off the tops and bottoms of onions so they can sit on a plate. Cut in half at the equator and peel. Arrange onions halves, cut side up, in the baking dish.

Brush the tops of onions with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake for about 35 mintues.

In a glass measuring cup, mix together broth and soy sauce and pour this over the onions. Continue to bake for 1 hour longer, basting occasionally. 

Sprinkle the cheese and sage evenly over onions. Bake for 5-7 minutes longer.

If using regular broth and soy sauce, omit salt.
