--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  8             slices  white or whole wheat sandwich bread
  6             slices  bacon
  6              large  eggs
                        coarse salt and ground pepper

Preheat oven to 375. Butter standard muffin tin. Use a rolling pin to roll bread flat. Cut rounds with a 4.5" cookie cutter. Cut each round in half and press 2 halves into tin, overlapping slightly. Use lefrovers to make patches. Brush with butter.

In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium until almost crisp, 4 minutes, flipping once. Lay 1 bacon slice in each cup and crack an egg over each. Season with salt and pepper. Bake until egg whites are just set, 20 to 25 minutes. Run a small knife around each and serve.



































































































































































Preheat oven to 375. Lightly butter 6 standard muffin cups. With a rolling pin, flatten bread slices slightly, and with a 4.25 inch cookie cutter, cut into 8 rounds. Cut each round in half, then press 2 halves into each muffin cup, overlapping slightly and making sure bead comes up to edge of cup. Use extra bread to patch gaps. Brush with remaining butter.
