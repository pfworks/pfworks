  3             slices  bacon -- 1/4" pieces
     1/2           cup  panko crumbs
                        salt and pepper
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1              large  head cauliflower (about 3 lbs) -- 1" florets
  1                     onion -- finely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh thyme
  1              pound  campanelle
  5 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  1           teaspoon  lemon juice
                        lemon wedges

Cook bacon in 12 inch skillet over medium high heat until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Add panko and 1/4 tspn pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until panko is well browned, 2-4 minutes. Transfer mixture to bowl and wipe skillet.

Heat 5 tablespoons oil in skillet over med-high heat until shimmering. Add cauliflower and 1 tspn salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is crisp-tender and browned in spots, 10-12 minutes. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.

Heat remaining 1 tspn oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, thyme, and 1/2 tspn salt; cook, stirring frequently, until onion has softened, 4-7 minutes. Increase heat to high, add pasta, broth and wine, and bring to simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid is absorbed and pasta is al dente, 8-10 minutes.

Remove pot from heat; stir in parsley, lemon juice, and cauliflower; and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve, passing pank mixture and lemon wedges.
