--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     whole potatoes -- unpeeled
  1                cup  unseasoned breadcrumbs -- fine
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- finely grated
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  black pepper -- finely ground
     1/2      teaspoon  paprika
     1/2           cup  butter -- melted

Wash and scrub the potatoes and allow them to dry. Slice each, with skin on, into 6 wedges.

Partially cook the potato wedges either by deep frying or parboiling until about half done.

Set aside and allow the wedges to drain or blot with a paper towel.

Preheat oven to 400.

Mix together all of the dry ingredients, exclude the butter.

Dip the partially cooked potatoes in the melted butter and then roll them in the mixture.

Using a buttered baking dish, bake the potatoes in the oven until crisp and brown, about 30 minutes, turining once.
