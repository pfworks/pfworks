--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  small Yukon gold potatoes
                        salt
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1              small  yellow onion -- roughly chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- roughly chopped
  2               cups  corn kernels
                        black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream

Place the potatoes in a large pot, cover with cold water and season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain well, then cool slightly. Return potatoes to the pot and using a masher, mash.



Melt butter in a medium, heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and corn and saute about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cream and cook over med-low heat for 3 minutes longer.

Add the sauteed corn to the mashed potatoes and stir to combine until liquid is fully absorbed. Season with salt and pepper.
