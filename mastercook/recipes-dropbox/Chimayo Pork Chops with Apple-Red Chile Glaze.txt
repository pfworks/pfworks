  1 1/3           cups  Mexican BBQ Sauce
     3/4           cup  apple juice concentrate -- thawed

In a shallow, non reactive dish, whisk together BBQ sauce, apple juice, and 1/4 tspn salt. Reserve 1/3 cup of the mixture. Add the chops, cover and marinate, turning occassionally for 2 hours at room temp or overnight chilled. (return to room temp)

Light a direct heat charcoal fire and let it burn to medium hot (5 seconds to "ouch"). Position rack 6 inches above heat.

Lightly oil rack when ready. Lift chops from marinade (reserve it) and lay them on the rack. Cover and grill, turning once and basting with marinade, until it is used up and the chops are nicely marked, about 9 minutes total.

Transfer meat to plates. Season with salt and pepper. Top each with a dollop of the remaining 1/3 cup sauce.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  bulb garlic
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     plum tomato
     1/2         small  onion
  1 1/3           cups  Mexican Dried Red Chile Puree
     1/3           cup  sherry wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  packed dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  mexican oregano -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon -- ground
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin -- toasted and ground

  1              pinch  clove -- ground

Position rack about 6 inches from heat source and preheat to 400

Remove the loose, papery outside peels of the garlic bulb. With a sharp knife, cut off top 1/4 of the bulb, exposing the cloves within. Partially enclose in heavy duty foil. Drizzle evenly with olive oil and sherry. Seal tightly and set in oven to bake until tender and fragrant, about 1 hour. Cool, then scoop or squeeze garlic out.

Put rack about 6 inches from broiler and preheat. In a shallow metal pan, broil the tomatoes and onion half, turning once, until well charred, about 15 minutes total. Remove and cool. Coarsely chop tomatoes (do not peel) and onion.

In a food processor process everything, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides.
