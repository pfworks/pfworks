                        sauce bearnaise
  1         tablespoon  shallot -- minced
  2        tablespoons  fresh tarragon leaves and stalks -- chopped and separated
  1         tablespoon  chervil -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  tarragon vinegar
  2        tablespoons  white wine
  1           teaspoon  white peppercorns -- crushed
  3                     egg yolks
  1         tablespoon  water
  16       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- soft, cut into 1/2 inch dice

                        freshly ground black pepper
     1/2                lemon -- juiced

For the steak, preheat a large saute pan over medium high heat. Oil the rump steak and then place into the preheated pan. Cook for about 2 minutes on the first side, the flip and cook for another 2 minutes. Cook 1-2 minutes more per side for med-rare. Let rest for 5-10 minutes.

Put the shallot, tarragon stalks, 1 tbspn of tarragon leaves and the chervil, and the vinegar, wine and peppercorns in a saucepan and boil until reduced to about 1 tablespoon.

Press the reduced liquid through a regular or tea strainer and leave to cool. Put egg yolks and water in the top of a double boiler. Set over the bottom, in which water has come to a simmer. Add the reduced and strained liquid and whisk well. Keep whisking as you add the butter, cube by cube, until it is all absorbed. Taste, season with salt and pepper, add lemon juice. Stir in remaining tarragon leaves and serve with steak.
