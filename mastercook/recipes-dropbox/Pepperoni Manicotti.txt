                        meat sauce
  7             ounces  sliced pepperoni
  1              pound  ground beef
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  5             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  italian seasoning
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  48            ounces  spaghetti sauce
                        salt and pepper
                        filling
  2               cups  ricotta cheese
  1                cup  shredded italian cheese blend
  4             ounces  provolone cheese -- chopped fine
  2              large  egg -- lightly beaten
                        salt and pepper
                        other
  16                    no boil lasagna noodles
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated

Adjust oven rack to upper middle and preheat to 375.

Pulse the pepperoni in a food processor until ground. Add the ground beef and pulse until thoroughly combined.

Transfer meat mixture to a large saucepan. Add the onion, garlic, and spices and cook over medium heat, breaking up mixture, until beef is no longer pink, about 5 minutes.

Using slotted spoon, transfer 1 cup to paper towel lined plate and reserve.

Add spaghetti sauce to meat in saucepan and simmer until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. 

Pour 2 quarts very hot water into a 13x9 baking dish. Place noodled into water one at a time. Soak until pliable, about 8-10 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine all filling ingredients and reserved meat. Mix well.

Drain noodles and place them in a single layer on paper towels. Pout off water and dry dish. Spread half of meat sauce on bottom of dish.

With short side facing you, spread 1/4 cup of the filling across the bottom of each noodle and roll into a tube. Arrange the rolled manicotti, seam-side down, over the sauce in the dish. Spread remaining sauce over top. Cover with foil and bake until bubbling on edges, about 40 minutes.

Remove and sprinkle with parmesan. Bake uncovered for 5 more minutes. Let cool 15 minutes.
