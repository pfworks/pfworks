  3              whole  small tomatoes, roma or italian plum
  12                    chiles de arbol
     1/2         small  white onion -- chunked
  3                     garlic clove
     1/2           cup  water
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt

Heat broiler.

Place the tomatoes on a small baking sheet, covered with foil for easier cleaning. Broil tomatoes for 15 to 18 minutes, turning occassionally, until the tomatoes are soft and the skins split and turn dark in spots. Cool briefly.

While tomatoes broil, simmer the chiles, onion and garlic in the water in a small pan until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain the mixture, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Transfer the mixture, the reserved liquid, the roasted tomatoes (with peels and cores), and remaining ingredients to a blender. Puree briefly until semismooth. Chill at least 1 hour.
