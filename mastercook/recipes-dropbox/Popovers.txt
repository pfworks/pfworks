--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  bread flour
                        vegetable shortening
  3              large  eggs
  2               cups  low-fat milk, heated to 110
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted and cooled slightly
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  sugar

Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat oven to 450. Grease the interior of a 6-cup popover pan with the shortening, then dust lightly with flour. Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl until light and foamy. Slowly whisk in the milk and butter until incorporated.

Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk three-quarters of the milk mixture into the flour mixture until no lumps remain, then whisk in the remaining milk mixture. Transfer batter to a large measuring cup, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temp for 1 hour.

Whisk batter to recombine, then pour it into the prepared pan. Bake until just beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Without opening oven door, decrease temperature to 300 and continue to bake until the popovers are golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes longer. Poke a small hole in the top of each popover with a skewer and continue to bake until deep golden brown, about 10 minutes longer. Transfer pan to wire rack. Poke again with skewer and let cool for 2 minutes. Turn out and serve.
