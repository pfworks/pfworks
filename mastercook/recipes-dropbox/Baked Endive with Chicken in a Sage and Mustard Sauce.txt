  4              heads  white chicory (belgian endive)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  3        tablespoons  dry white wine
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast
  1              ounce  butter
  1                     shallot -- chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- chopped
                        sauce
  1              ounce  butter
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2         pinch  milk
     1/4         pinch  sour cream
  6                     sage leaves -- chopped
  3          teaspoons  dijon mustard
  3          teaspoons  whole grain dijon mustard
  2             ounces  gruyere cheese -- grated

Preheat oven to 350. Trim away the stalk ends of chicory, discard any limp or tired outer leaves, then cut lengthwise into quarters. Pour the oil over the bottom of a large, shallow baking dish and arrange the sections of chicory, cut-side up, in a single layer. Pour over the wine or stock and cover with foil. Bake for 10 minutes.

Slice the chicken into strips 1cm thick. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Melt the butter in a large frying pan until foaming, add sliced chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes or until chicken is turning golden brown. Stir in the shallot and garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove dish from oven and add chicken mixture to the chicory. Replace the foil and set the dish aside while you make the sauce.

Melt the butter for the sauce in the frying pan then stir in the flour. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly until it thickens. Remove from heat and stir in sour cream and sage with 2 tspns of each mustard. Add extra mustard and salt and pepper if needed.

Pour sauce over chicken and chicory and sprinkle cheese on top. Bake, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes, until sauce is bubbling and golden.
