  4                     boneless, skinless chicken breasts

                        vegetable oil
                        salt and pepper
  1                cup  chicken broth
  1                 in  ginger root -- peeled and chopped
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/2           cup  teriyaki sauce
  1         tablespoon  toasted sesame oil
  4                     scallions -- thinly sliced
  1                     ripe pineapple

Preheat a grill pan or large griddle over medium heat.

Bring water to a boil in a small covered pot. Add butter, salt and rice to the pot. Return the water to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and replace cover. Simmer 18 minutes and remove rice from heat. Take the lid off the pot to cool rice a bit. Scoop rice into balls with an ice cream scoop and your hands. Dampen hands to work with rice if it is very sticky. Set rice balls on plate and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

While your rice is cooking, lightly coat chicken with oil, salt and pepper. Place chicken on hot grill and cook 6 minutes on the first side.

While chicken is cooking, bring broth and ginger to a boil. Stir in honey. When honey has dissolved into broth, add teriyaki sauce and reduce heat to a simmer.

Turn chicken and coat liberally with honey teriyaki sauce using a basting brush. Cook chicken 4 minutes, turn and baste again, and cook 2 minutes longer. Remove to a plate. Garnish with scallions.

While chicken cooks on the second side, peel and cut a ripe pineapple into 8 spears. Cut off top and bottom of pineapple. Set pineapple upright and trim away skin in strips from top to bottom. Halve pineapple lengthwise and 1/4 each 1/2, lengthwise. Serve with chicken and rice balls.
