  4                     10 oz pork chops, thick-cut, bone-in
                        salt
                        black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                cup  pecans -- chopped
                        Ancho Chile Pepper Barbecue Sauce

Preheat oven to 350.

Season pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Pour 1 tablespoon olive oil on a plate and spread pecans on another plate. Lay each pork chop in the olive oil to coat and then coat both sides with chopped pecans.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add pork chops and cook until pecans are light brown on that side. Turn over in pan and place in the oven until 165, about 10 minutes. Drizzle with BBQ sauce.
