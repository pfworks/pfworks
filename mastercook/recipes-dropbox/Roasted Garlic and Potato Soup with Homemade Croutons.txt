  1              large  garlic head -- unpeeled
  6        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2                     bay leaf
     1/4                load day old french baguette -- cubed
     3/4      teaspoon  sea salt
  1             medium  yellow onion -- chopped
  1              small  carrot -- chopped
  1 1/2         pounds  red creamer potatoes -- peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes
     1/2      teaspoon  white pepper
  3               cups  chicken broth
  4             ounces  fontina cheese -- 1/4" cubes

Preheat oven to 400. Using a serrated knife, slice off top quarter of garlic head, revealing cloves. Place on a 12x8 sheet of foil, cut side up, and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add 1 bay leaf. Fold over garlic and seal edges. Roast in dish until garlic is soft and golden brown, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.

Meanwhile, on a rimmed baking sheet, toss together bread, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt to taste. Bake, stirring once or twice, until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain.

In a medium pot over medium-high heat, heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Add carrot, onion, and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion and carrot have softened, 8-10 minutes. Mix in 3/4 tspn salt and 1/2 tspn white pepper and add remaining bay leaf. Add broth and 2 cups water to vegetables, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and allow soup to simmer until potatoes are very tender, 30 minutes. Remove bay leaf.

Squeeze garlic head, from bottom up, to push out each clove in soup; stir. Simmer for 5 more minutes, then remove from heat. Using a blender, puree. Whisk fontina into soup over low heat until cheese melts and is incorporated. Sprinkle with croutons.
