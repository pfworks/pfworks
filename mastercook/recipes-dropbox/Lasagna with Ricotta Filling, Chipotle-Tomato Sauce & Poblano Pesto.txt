                        Lasagna
  32            ounces  whole ricotta milk cheese
  1           teaspoon  freshly grated nutmeg
  1                cup  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  12                    "no boil" lasagna noodles
  1 1/4           cups  mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Sauce: Heat the oii in a heavy saucpan over medium heat and add the onion. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the garlic and continue cooking another 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat, stir in the oregano, coriander, cumin, chipotle, salt and sugar. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until thickened slightly. Remove from heat and cool for 10 minutes.

Pesto: Preheat oven to 400. Soak the tomatillos in hot water for 10 minutes. Remove the outer papery husk and pat the tomatillos dry with paper towels. Toss them with 2 tablespoons oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned. Cool.

Place the garlic in a small skillet with 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Saute until cloves are lightly browned and set aside.

Place the garlic and pinon in the work bowl of a processor and finely chop. Add the tomatillos and juice, the poblanos and remaining oil and puree until smooth. Season with salt and jalepeno juice. Make sure it is thin enough to drizzle, adding a few tablespoons of water if necessary. Put in container and press plastic wrap into the surface to cover.

Lasagna: Preheat oven to 400.

Mix the ricotta, nutmeg and cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Brush the botton of a 9x13 baking dish with a little olive oil and spread 1 cup of the Chipotle-Tomato sauce over the bottom of the dish. Place three of the noodles over the sauce, leaving a little space between them. Spread 1 cup of the ricotta mixture over the noddles. Repeat twice more, ending with noodles and sauce. Cover the dish tightly with foil and bke on the middle shelf for 40-45 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle the top with mozzarella cheese. Bake, uncovered, 15 minutes more, or until warm and bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes.

To serve, warm remaining sauce and ladle 4 tablespoons onto a dinner plate, spreading it out. Place lasagna on top and garnish with Poblano Pesto.
