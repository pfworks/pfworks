                        adobo
  4                     dried guajillo chiles
  3                     dried ancho chiles
  2          teaspoons  cumin seed
     1/2          inch  cinnamon stick -- smashed
  2              whole  allspice
  1                     clove
  4             cloves  garlic -- smashed
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  1 1/2      teaspoons  thyme leaves
     1/3           cup  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        turkey and gravy
  1                     12-14 lb turkey -- neck and giblets (excluding liver) reserved for stock
  2               cups  water
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  4               cups  turkey stock
     1/3           cup  all-purpose flour
                        unsalted butter

Slit chiles lengthwise, then stem and seed. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then toast chiles in batches, opening them flat, turning and pressing with tongs, until more pliable and slightly changed in color, about 30 seconds per batch.

Transfer to a bowl and cover with boiling water, then soak for about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, toast spices in a small skillet over med-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.

Drain chiles, discarding liquid, and puree in a blender with spices, garlic, herbs, vinegar, water, oil, and 2 tspns salt until very smooth. Set aside 1/2 cup for gravy.

Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Sprinkle 2 tspns salt evenly in turkey cavities and all over skin, then rub remaining adobo all over turkey, including cavities. Fold neck skin under body, then tuck wing tip under breast and tie drumsticks together with string. Transfer to rack in roasting pn and marinate, covered in plastic wrap and chilled, at least 8 hours and up to 24.

Let turkey stand, covered at room temperature for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 with rack in lower third. Add 1 cup water to pan and roast turkey 1 hour.

Brush turkey with oil and add remaining 1 cup water, then tent loosely with foil and rotate pan. Roast until thermometer registers 170, 1 3/4 to 2 3/4 hours more. If pan becomes dry, add 1/2 cup more water.

Carefully tilt turkey so juices run into pan. Transfer turkey to a platter and let stand, uncovered, 30 minutes.

Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then add 1 cup turkey stock and boil over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes. Strain juices through fine mesh sieve into 2 qt measure and skim off fat, reserving fat. Add enough turkey stock to bring to 5 cups.

Whisk together flour, 6 tbspns fat, (use butter if not enough), and reserved 1/2 cup adobo in a heavy medium saucepan, then cook over med heat, whisking constantly, 3 minutes. Add pan juices and stock in a fast stream, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil, whisking, then simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt. Serve turkey with gravy.
