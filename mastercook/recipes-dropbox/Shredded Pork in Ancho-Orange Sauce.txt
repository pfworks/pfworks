  3             pounds  boneless pork butt -- 2" cubes
  1 1/4           cups  freshly squeezed orange juice
  1 1/4           cups  water
  1 1/4      teaspoons  kosher or sea salt
  4                     ancho chiles -- rinsed, stemmed and seeded
     1/2           cup  white onion -- chopped
  4             cloves  garlic
     1/2           cup  Italian parsley -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper
     2/3           cup  apple cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        flour tortilla

Place the pork in a heavy 12" skillet or Dutch oven. Add the orange juice, water, and 1 tspn of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to medium and simmer for 40-45 minutes, or until most of the liquid has cooked away and the meat is lightly browned and has rendered most of its fat. Set aside to cool.

Place chiles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and soak 10-15 minutes until softened.

Place the chiles, along with 1 1/2 cups of liquid, in  blender along with onion, garlic, parsley, oregano, cumin, remaining salt, pepper, and vinegar and puree until smooth.

Shred the pork and put it and juices into large bowl.

IN the meat pot, heat oil over medium heat. Pour in chile puree, bring to a simmer, and simmer for 8-10 minutes, stirring often, until thickened and darkened. Toss in the meat and juices and cook until abosorbed, 20-25 minutes.
