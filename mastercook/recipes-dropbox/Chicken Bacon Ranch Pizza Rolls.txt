  1                     roll refrigerated pizza dough
  1                     packet ranch dressing mix
  2        tablespoons  parmesan cheese -- grated
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
                        cubed cheddar cheese
  8             slices  bacon -- cooked and crumbled
  1                cup  cooked shredded chicken
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
     3/4           cup  milk

Measure out 1 teaspoon of ranch dressing mix and combine it with 1.5T parmesan cheese. Set aside. Combine the remaining ranch mix with 3/4 C mayo and 3/4 C milk and place in fridge to chill.

Preheat oven to specified temperature on dough package. Unroll on lightly floured surface. Pat or roll so it's about 12x8. Cut into 24 squares. Place cheese and toppings on each square. Wrap 4 corners of dough around the toppings. Place each seam side down in a lightly sprayed pie pan. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with parmesan-ranch mixture. Place in oven. Cook for 10-25 minutes or until lightly golden. Serve with dressing.
