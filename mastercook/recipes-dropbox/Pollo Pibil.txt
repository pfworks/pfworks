--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4          teaspoons  cumin seeds
  1                     cinnamon stick -- 3" long
  1           teaspoon  whole clove
  1 1/2    tablespoons  black peppercorn
  4             ounces  achiote paste
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  garlic -- finely minced
  2               cups  orange juice
     1/2           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  fresh marjoram leaves or 1 tbs dried
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  6               each  skinless boneless chicken breast -- halved
                        banana leaves
  6                     grilled scallions

To prepare the chicken, roast the cumin, cinnamon, cloves and peppercorns in a small, dry saute pan over medium heat, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove the spices from the heat and let them cool. Place the spices in a spice mill, coffee grinder or mortar and grind till pulverized.

Put the spices, achiote paste, salt, garlic, orange and lime juices, marjoram and oil in a blender or food processor and process just long enough to blend.

Place the chicken breasts in a shallow non reactive dish and pour the spice mixture evenly over the top to cover completely. Cover the dish and let the chicken marinate for at least 24 hours (up to 36) turning frequently.

Prepare a fire in a charcoal grill. When the coals are medium hot, remove the chicken breasts from the marinade and place them skin down on the grill 6 inches above the coals. Grill them, turning once, until they're done, 15 to 20 minutes total grilling time.

Garnish each breast with one grilled scallion and serve on a banana leaf.
