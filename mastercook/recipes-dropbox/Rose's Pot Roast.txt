--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  lean beef roast
  2                     onions -- sliced
  1                     lemon -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ginger -- ground
  12                    whole black peppercorn
  2               cups  red wine
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  flour
     1/4           cup  water

Place the roast in a deep bowl. Add the onion and lemon slices, sugar, salt, ginger, peppercorns, and enough wine to cover more than half the roast. Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours, turning occasionally.

When ready to cook, drain the roast and pat it dry, reserving the marinade. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven and brown the roast on all sides. Strain the reserved marinade and add it to the pot. Cover and simmer for 3-4 hours, adding water as necessary. When tender, remove the roast to a platter.

Mix the flour and water in a small bowl and add it to the remaining liquid in the pot. Cook, stirring until the sauce is thickened. Return the roast to the pot for a quick reheat. Serve the roast and gravy with either cooked noodles or baked potatoes.
