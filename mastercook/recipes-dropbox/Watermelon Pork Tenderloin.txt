  2                     jalepenos -- seeded and finely diced
  1              bunch  fresh cilantro -- stemmed
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2                     limes -- squeezed
  1               dash  rice wine vinegar
                        sea salt and pepper
			
  2             pounds  pork tenderloin
  3               cups  watermelon -- seeded and diced
  3                     jalepenos -- seeded and diced
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  melon liquer
                        sea salt and pepper

Combine all salsa ingredients in a medium bowl and chill until ready to serve.

Use a sharp knife to trim tenderloin of any fat by removing as much silver skin as possible.

Combine watermelon and jalepenos in a blender and puree, about 2-3 minutes. Strain mixture through a fine sieve and return to blender. Add the salt, sugar and melon liquer to blender and blend together, about 2-3 minutes. Reserve 1 cup or marinade for basting. Draw remaining marinade with syringe injector. Inject pork liberally. Sprinkle salt and pepper to cover pork. Let marinate while heating the grill.

Remove pork from platter and place directly on the flame for direct heat. Roll the pork over the direct heat to give it grill marks. Remove pork from direct heat and place away from the flame to finish cooking. Baste with glaze every 10 to 15 minutes until pork reaches an internal temperature of 145F. Remove from the grill to platter and let cool for 5 minutes. Slice into medallions and server with watermelon salsa.
