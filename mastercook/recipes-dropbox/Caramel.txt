--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cold water
  3               cups  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream

Combine water and sugar in medium saucepan. Set over med-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves (about 3 minutes), making sure no sugar is sticking to the sides of the pan. Increase heat to high and boil without stirring, until the syrup becomes a deep amber color, about 15 minutes. To prevent the syrup from becoming grainy, use a pastry brush dipped into cold water to brush down any sugar crystals sticking to the sides of the pan. Swirl the pan occasionally for even browning.

Once the syrup turns deep amber in color, immediately remove from heat. Slowly and carefully add the cream to the syrup, whisking constantly, until cream is incorporated.

Return the pan to med-low heat, stirring until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute.

Remove from heat and allow to come to room temperature before refrigerating. Can be stored up to 1 month.
