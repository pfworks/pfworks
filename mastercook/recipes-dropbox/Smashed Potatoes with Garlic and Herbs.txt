  1              pound  baby new potatoes -- scrubbed
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced

                        salt and pepper

Preheat oven to 450.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil, and add potatoes. Simmer 10 to 15 minutes, until just tender when pierced with a knife, but not falling apart.

Drain potatoes and let cool for 5 minutes, then use bottom of a glass to smash lightly, so that they remain in place but the skin breaks. Transfer to a baking dish and drizzle with oil, salt and pepper, and roast for 30-45 minutes, untll the edges start to turn golden and crispy.

Remove pan from oven, stir in garlic and herbs, and serve.
