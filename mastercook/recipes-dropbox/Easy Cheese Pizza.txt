--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  head garlic
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1 3/4           cups  flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sugar
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  lukewarm (110) milk
     3/4           cup  pizza sauce
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  parsley -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  Parmigiano-Reggiano -- shredded

Preheat oven to 350. Slice off top of garlic head to reveal cloves and drizzle with 1 tspn olive oil. Wrap garlic in foil, place in upper third of oven, and roast until cloves are easily pierced with a knife, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside.

Meanwhile, combine flour, yeast, rosemary, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. In a separate bowl, combine milk, 3 tablespoons olive oil, and 6 tablespoons lukewarm (110) water and add in a stream with processor running until dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and pliant, about 6 minutes.

Coat the inside of a large bowl with olive oil form dough into a ball, and rol it around bowl. Cover bowl loosely with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Let dough rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Increase oven to 375. Punch down dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface to fit into a 12 inch round pizza pan or baking sheet. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes. Mix sauce and 2 tablespoons parsley together. Squeeze roasted garlic cloves onto pizza and spread, leaving a 1/2" border. Top with sauce mixture, sprinkle on cheese, and bake 25 to 30 minutes. Garnish with remaining 2 tspns parsley.
