  2        tablespoons  granulated garlic
     1/3           cup  fresh cracked black pepper
     1/2           cup  garlic cloves
  3        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  2        tablespoons  Achiote Oil
  4             pounds  prime tri-tip roast

Combine granulated garlic and pepper in a small bowl and set aside. Mince the garlic and slowly incorporate the salt and sugar, alternating, to create a paste. Add the Achiote Oil and mix well.

Rinse and pat dry the roast and rub with the garlic paste, evenly coating the meat. Sprinkly evenly with the granulated garlic and pepper mixture and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 24-48 hours.

Remove the wrap and allow the roast to rest while preheating grill. Cook roast for 9 minutes and turn, repeat and check temp. Once 90 is reached, increase heat to sear all sides. Remove from grill and allow to rest for 10-15 minutes, loosely tented with foil.

Slice thinly across the grain  and drizzle any juices on top.
