--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- 2 inch cubes
  3             cloves  garlic -- peeled and diced
  1              large  white onion -- finely chopped, divided
  3             sprigs  fresh marjoram
  3             cloves  garlic -- unpeeled
  1 1/4         pounds  ripe roma tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo -- pureed
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  canela -- finely ground
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  ground clove
                        sea salt
                        corn tortilla

Place the pork in a large saucepan and cover with water be several inches. Salt the water liberally. Add 3 cloves diced garlic, half the onion and marjoram to the pan. Bring the water to a boil, skim the foam, reduce the heat and simmer for 2 hours, partially covered, until the pork is very tender. Cool the meat in the broth. Shred the pork and reserve.

Toast 3 cloves garlic in a small skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until soft, 8-10 minutes. Cool and peel. Roast the tomatoes until charred on all sides. Cool and peel, reserving juice.

Place the tomatoes and juices, chipotle and garlic in the blender and puree. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the puree and stir as it thickens, about 7 minutes. Season with salt.

Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the shredded pork and the remaining onion. Fry the mixture, stirring frequently, until it is browned and slightly crispy, about 15 minutes. Add the oregano, canela, pepper and cloves and stir for 1 minute. Pour on the sauce and stir occasionally until almost all the liquid has evaporated, about 6 to 8 minutes. Adjust seasonings.
