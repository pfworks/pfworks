--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  porterhouse (about 2 lbs)
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
                        olive oil
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil (for frying)
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        Black Mexican Chocolate Sauce
  1                     dried pasilla pepper -- seeded and chopped (reserve seeds)
  2                     chipotle chile canned in adobo -- seeded and chopped
  1                cup  cooked black beans
  1              ounce  dark chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  almonds -- toasted
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  2               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              clove  garlic -- peeled and crushed
  2                     shallot -- peeled and coarsely chopped (about 1/3 cup)
                        Pan Corn

Prepare the steak by salting it, then let it come to room temperature. Rub with a bit of olive oil just before cooking.

Rehydrate the pasilla chile by pouring boiling water over it and allowing it to soak for half an hour. When you're ready to make the sauce, pull the chile open and seed it. Chop coarsely and put in a blender or food processor with the chipotles, black beans, chocolate, almonds and salt. Blend, adding the stock slowly, allowing the blades to work as the sauce thins out.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan and gently saute the garlic and shallots over low heat. Once they're soft, add them to the blender and blend again. Transfer sauce to a saucepan and let simmer for 10 minutes. Keep an eye on it to avoid scalding. For a spicer sauce, grind the reserved seeds and add.

To grill: Put the oiled steak on hottest part of grill and sear for 3-5 minutes on each side over high heat. Move the steak to a cooler part of the grill and check often for about 8 to 12 minutes until done.

To pan fry: Heat the peanut oil in a heavy pan until it's very hot - almost smoking. Sear the steak for 3 minutes on each side over high heat before turning down the burner. Cook over moderate heat for an additional 8 to 12 minutes, turning every few minutes as it slowly browns. For steaks more than 2" thick, finish off in a 400 degree oven.

Make a small pool of sauce on the plate and put steak on it. Put plenty of corn and have extra sauce available.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             slices  thick cut bacon
  2                     leeks -- bottom third sliced into rounds
  4               ears  sweet corn -- kernels shaved off cob
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Cook the bacon in a heavy frying pan until it's crisp. Transfer to a rack or paper towel to drain, then chop when it's cool. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the pan and add the leeks, cooking them gently until soft. Add the kernels and the bacon. Allow the corn to cook for a few minutes, the fresher the corn, the less cooking. Season with salt and pepper.
