--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             medium  russet potatoes (3 lbs) -- peeled and diced
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  3              large  egg yolk -- beaten
  6                     scallions (green included) -- finely chopped
  2               cups  extra sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
                        salt and pepper
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg

Preheat oven to 375.

Place potatoes in a large pot and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer till the potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes.

Drain water from pot, add the butter, and mash with a potato masher till they are smooth. Add milk, egg yolks, scallions, 1.5 cups of cheese, salt, pepper and nutmeg, and stir till well blended and creamy. Scrape into 1.5 qt buttered dish or casserole, sprinkle remaining cheese over top, and bake till top is glazed and slightly crusty, with a few dark spots, 25-30 minutes.
