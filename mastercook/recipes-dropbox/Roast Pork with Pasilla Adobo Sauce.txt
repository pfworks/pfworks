  6                     pasilla chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  2               cups  chicken broth
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano -- crushed
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1                cup  mexican lager-style beer, such as bohemia
  3             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  3             pounds  pork roast

In a saucepan, combine the chiles and chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and  simmer until soft, about 5 minutes.

In a skillet over med-high heat, cook the onion and garlic into the oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rehydrated chiles with their broth and the remaining ingredients, except the pork, and simmer for 10 minutes to blend the flavors. Place the sauce in a blender and puree until smooth.

Make deep gashes in the roast and push the sauce into the gashes. In a roasting pan, pour the remianing sauce over the meat and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.

Preheat the oven to 425F. Place the pork on a rack in a roasting pan. Put it in on the middle shelf of the oven, and immedialtely reduce the heat to 350. Cook the meat for 30-45 minutes per pound or until the internal temperature reaches 185. Baste frequently with the sauce. Place foil over top of the roast if it starts getting too brown.
