  3        tablespoons  bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  chicken broth
  1              pound  ground beef -- crumbled, not lean
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  fresh italian parsley -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 350.

In a small bowl, soften the bread crumbs with the chicken broth for several minutes.

In a larger bowl, thoroughly mix the beef, softened crumbs and remaining ingredients. Shape the mixture into 1.5" balls and set aside. Heat a large skillet over med-high and brown the meatballs in batches. As they brown, transfer then to a baking pan.

Finish meatballs in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until cooked through but not dry. Serve warm with Salsa Romesco.
