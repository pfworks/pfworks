                        crust
     1/4           cup  sugar
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- slightly softened
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  cold milk
  2          teaspoons  cold milk
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
                        filling
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  1                cup  yellow onion -- minced
  2               ribs  celery -- finely chopped
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/3         pound  ground pork
     1/3         pound  ground beef
  1         tablespoon  fresh thyme leaf -- minced
  2          teaspoons  cayenne pepper
  1 1/2      teaspoons  freshly ground pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  sweet smoked paprika
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1 1/2           cups  skin-on red potatoes -- coarsely grated
  1 1/2      teaspoons  worcestershire sauce
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sherry vinegar
  1                cup  beef broth
                        kosher salt
                        topping
  8             ounces  cream cheese
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fresh thyme -- minced
  1 1/4      teaspoons  lemon zest
                        kosher salt and black pepper

For the crust: Place sugar, butter, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle. Beat at high speed until creamy and fluffy. Beat in egg and milk, then reduce speed to medium and add flour, scraping down the side of the bowk and beating only until incorporated; do not over-mix. Shape dough into a flat disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350. Spray the sides and bottom on an 8" springform pan with cooking spray. Remove dough from fridge and set on a lightly floured work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a 10.5" circle about 1/4" thick.

Press dough into bottom and sides of prepared springform pan. Trim overhanging dough, and prick dough all over with a fork. Top with pie weights or dried beans and bake for 20 minutes. Remove weights and bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven.

For the filling: Melt butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add onions and celery and cook, stirring periodically, until vegetables start to soften, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and continue cooking for 1 minute. Add pork, beef, thyme, cayenne, black pepper, paprika, and oregano and cook, stirring and breaking up meat into bits, until meat is browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes longer. Add potatoes, worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and broth. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, for 10 minutes. Strain off excess liquid and cool.

Topping: Add cream cheese, heavy cream, thyme, and lemon zest to a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper and beat using a handheld until creamy.

Spoon filling into crust and top with cream cheese, taking care to spread it evenly over the entire surface. Bake until top is browned and bubbly, about 50 minutes.

Let cool 10 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve.
