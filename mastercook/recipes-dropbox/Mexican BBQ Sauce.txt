  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  4                     plum tomato
     1/2         small  onion
  1 1/3           cups  Mexican Dried Red Chile Puree
     1/3           cup  sherry wine vinegar
  2        tablespoons  packed dark brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  salt
  1 1/4      teaspoons  mexican oregano -- crumbled
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon -- ground
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin -- toasted and ground
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper -- freshly ground
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme -- crumbled
  1              pinch  clove -- ground

Position rack about 6 inches from heat source and preheat to 400

Remove the loose, papery outside peels of the garlic bulb. With a sharp knife, cut off top 1/4 of the bulb, exposing the cloves within. Partially enclose in heavy duty foil. Drizzle evenly with olive oil and sherry. Seal tightly and set in oven to bake until tender and fragrant, about 1 hour. Cool, then scoop or squeeze garlic out.

Put rack about 6 inches from broiler and preheat. In a shallow metal pan, broil the tomatoes and onion half, turning once, until well charred, about 15 minutes total. Remove and cool. Coarsely chop tomatoes (do not peel) and onion.

In a food processor process everything, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides.
