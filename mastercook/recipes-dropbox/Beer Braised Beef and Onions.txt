--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  onions
  5             pounds  boneless beef chuck roast -- tied
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2                     turkish bay leaves or 1 California
  24            ounces  pilsner style beer such as Bud
  2        tablespoons  red wine vinegar

Halve onions lengthwise, the slice lengthwise 1/4" thick.

Pat beef dry and season all over with 2.5 tspns salt and 1 tspn pepper. Heat 1 tbspn oil in a wide 5-6 qt heavy pot over med-high heat until it shimmers. Brown beef on all sides, about 15 minutes, then transfer to a plate.

Cook onions with bay leaves and 1/2 tspn salt in remaining 1 tbspn oil in pot, scraping up brown bits and stirring occasionally, until onions are well browned, about 25 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 with rack in middle. Cut a round of parchment paper the diameter of the inside of pot (near the top). Set aside.

Add beer and vinegar to onions and bring to a boil, stirring and scraping up brown bits. Add beef and meat juices from plate and return to a boil.

Cover with round and lid and braise in oven until meat is very tender, about 3.5 hours.

Transfer beef to board and let stand, loosely covered, 20 minutes. Cut off string, then sliced meat. Skim fat from sauce and discard bay leaves.

Serve beef with onions and sauce.
