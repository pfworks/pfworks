  5               cups  apple cider
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
                        kosher salt
  4                     bone-in, double cut pork chops, about 1 ln each
     3/4           cup  yellow mustard
     1/4           cup  whole grain mustard
     1/4           cup  dark brown sugar
     1/3           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  water
  2          teaspoons  worcestershire sauce
  1              clove  garlic -- minced

In a medium bowk, whisk the apple cider with the light brown sugar and 1/4 cup of kosher salt until dissolved. Pour into large plastic bag. Add the chops, seal and refrigerate overnight.

In a small saucepan, combine mustards with dark brown sugar, cider vinegar, water, worcestshire sauce and garlic. Simmer over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the butter and season with Tabasco and salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Remove chops from the brine and pat dry with towels. Season with salt and pepper. Grill over high heat until nicely browned, about 5 minutes per side. Move chops to cool side of grill and cook until 145, 10-15 minutes. Let rest for 5 minutes, and serve with warm sauce.
