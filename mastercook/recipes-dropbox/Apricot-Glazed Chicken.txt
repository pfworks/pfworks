     1/2           cup  shallot -- finely chopped
     1/4           cup  peeled ginger -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil

  16                    chicken drumstick

Cook shallots and ginger in oil in a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until softened and golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in vinegar and boil until reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Add soy sauce, preservers and 1/4 tspn of salt and pepper and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes.

Puree sauce in a blender until smooth then cool to room temp.

Divide chicken into 2 bags and pour marinade over chicken. Seal bags and marinate, chilled at least 8 hours.

Preheat oven to 425 with rack in middle.

Line a 17x12 baking pan with overlapping sheets of foil, then lightly oil. Arrange chicken in a single layer. Roast chicken, turning once, until deep brown, cooked through and glazed, about 40 minutes.
