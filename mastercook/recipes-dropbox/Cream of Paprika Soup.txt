--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     onion -- chopped
  2             stalks  celery -- chopped
  1              quart  chicken broth
  1              pound  vegetables (such as carrots and asparagus) -- coarsely chopped
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  2        tablespoons  hot hungarian paprika
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
                        salt and pepper

In a large skillet, combine the onion, celery and broth. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove and puree in a blender until smooth. Return to the heat, add the vegetables, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix the flour and the paprika with the water to make a paste and stir into the soup mixture. Heat until the soup thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and slowly stir in the cream. Return to the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until hot, taking care not to let the soup boil. Season with salt and pepper.
