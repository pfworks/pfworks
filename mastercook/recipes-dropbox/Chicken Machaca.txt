  2             pounds  boneless, skinless chicken breasts
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  2              small  roma tomato -- chopped
     1/2                red bell pepper -- diced
     1/2                yellow bell pepper -- diced
  2                     jalapeno -- minced
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  white wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
  2        tablespoons  fresh cilantro -- minced

Pound the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness and slice them into ribbons about 1/2 inch wide.

Warm a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Pour in the oil and swirl it around the pan. Add the chicken and cook it through quickly, stirring continuously. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a nearby plate. Add the onion, tomato, bell peppers, and jalapeno to the skillet and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the garlic, soy sauce, vinegar and cumin. Cook another 1 to 2 minutes, then add the chicken back and heat through.

Serve and garnish with cilantro.
