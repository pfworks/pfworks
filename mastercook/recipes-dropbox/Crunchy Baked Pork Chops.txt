  4             slices  hearty white sandwich bread -- torn into 1" pieces
  1              small  shallot (about 2 tablespoons) -- minced
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        black pepper
  2        tablespoons  grated parmesan cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  minced fresh thyme leaves

     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350. Dissolve 1/4 cup salt in 1 quart water in medium container or gallon resealable bag. Submerge chops, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes. Rinse under cold water and dry with paper towels.

Meanwhile, pulse bread in food processor until coarsely ground, about 8 1 second pulses. (about 3.5 cups crumb) Transfer crumbs to a rimmed baking sheet and add shallot, garlic, oil, 1/4 tspn salt and 1/4 tspn pepper. Toss until crumbs are evenly coated with oil. Bake until deep golden brown and dry, about 15 minutes, stirring twice. Cool to room temperature. Toss crumbs with parmesan, thyme and parsley.

Place 1/4 cup flour in pie plate. In second pie plate, whisk egg whites and mustard until combined; add remaining 6 tablespoons flour and whisk until almost smooth, with pea-sized lumps remaining.

Increase oven to 425. Spray wire rack with nonstck cooking spray and place in rimmed baking sheet. Season chops with pepper. Dredge 1 pork chop in flour, shake off excess. Using tongs, coat with egg mixture; let excess drip off. Coat all sides with bread mixture, pressing so that a thick layer adheres. Transfer to wire rack. Repeat.

Bake until 150, 17-25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes on rack. Serve with lemon wedges.
