     1/3           cup  prepared horseradish
     1/3           cup  mayonnaise
  1           teaspoon  juice from 1 lemon
  1             medium  garlic clove -- minced
  1              pinch  cayenne pepper
                        salt and pepper
                        beef
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  paprika
  1           teaspoon  ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  3             pounds  boneless eye round roast -- trimmed
  2          teaspoons  vegetable oil
  8                     kaiser rolls
  1                     yellow onion -- thinly sliced

Whisk all sauce ingredients together, salt and pepper to taste.

Combine salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne in bowl. Pat roast dry with paper towels and rub evenly with spice mixture. Wrap roast in plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours, but let sit at room temp for 1 hour. Before cooking, unwrap roast and rub evenly with oil.

Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 qts, about 100 briquettes) and burn until coals are fully ignited and parially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Build modified 2-level fire by arranging coals over half of grill, leaving other half empty. Position grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Scrape grate clean with brush. Grill is ready when coals are hot.

Lightly dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Cook, turning often, until evenly blackened on all sides and center of roast registers 100 degrees, about 30 minutes.

Transfer roast to carving board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Cut roast in half lengthwise, then slice it against grain as thinly as possible. Divide meat among rolls, top with sliced onion and sauce, and serve.
