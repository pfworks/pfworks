  2        tablespoons  cornstarch dissolved in 1 tbspn water
                        salt
                        juice of 1 lime
                        steak
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  crushed whole coriander
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1         tablespoon  paprika
     1/2    tablespoon  cayenne
  1         tablespoon  salt
  4             pounds  center cut beef tenderloin -- cut into 12 medallions

For the gravy, in a heavy bottomed pot or Dutch oven, warm oil over low, then add onion, carrot, celery and garlic. Cook slowly to carmelize, adding just enough oil to keep from sticking. When very soft and slightly brown, add the black pepper, coriander, chiles, cinnamon and lemongrass. Saute for a couple of minutes until chile pieces are soft, then add stocks, cilantro, thyme and bay leaf.

Simmer until liquids are reduced by one third, stirring occasionally. Carefully strain and discard solids. Return to pot, add cornstarch mixture, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes. Season with salt and lime juice.

Combine dry ingredients. Drench tenderloiins in the rub as if breading them. Grill over mesquite or chicory, 4-9 minutes per side.

Serve with gravy.
