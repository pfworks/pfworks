                        meat sauce
  6             ounces  thick-sliced bacon -- 1" pieces
  2              large  onion -- finely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
  3                     clove
  1                     star anise pod
  3             stalks  celery -- finely chopped
  5             cloves  garlic (3 minced, 2 sliced)
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  8             ounces  ground beef chuck
  8             ounces  ground pork butt
  1 1/4           cups  white wine
     3/4           cup  evaporated milk
  3               cups  beef broth
  2                     28oz can diced tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  2          teaspoons  dried marjoram
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  ketchup
  1         tablespoon  sherry vinegar
  1           teaspoon  worcestershire sauce
     1/3           cup  parmesan cheese -- finely grated
                        pasta
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2         pound  dry spaghetti

Place an 8 quart Dutch oven over low heat and add the bacon. Cook slowly until the bacon is crispy and has rendered its fat, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the bacon from the pan for another use. Add the onion, salt, and pepper and stir to combine. Place the clove and star anise into a small spice bag, add to the Dutch oven and stir to combine. Cook, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions carmelize, 45-60 minutes. Add the celery and the 3 cloves of minced garlic to the pan and continue to cook over low heat until the celery is semi-trnaslucent, about 30 minutes. Remove spice bag.

Meanwhile, place a wide 4 qt saute pan over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and once it shimmers, add the beef and pork, stirring, until the meat is browned, 4-5 minutes. Transfer to colander to drain. Return pan to high heat, add 1/2 cup of the wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Transfer these bits and remaining wine to the Dutch oven along with the meat.

Add another 1/2 cup wine, evaporated milk and beef broth to the Dutc oven and stir. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 3 hours.

Once the sauce has been cooking for 1.5 hours, place the 4 qt saute pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once it shimmers, add the 2 cloves of sliced garlic and cook for 30-45 seconds. Do not allow the garlic to brown. Add the tomatoes, oregano, basil, and marjoram and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 30 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup wine, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar, and worcestshire sauce and stir. Decrease the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Increase heat to med-high; add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and cook, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes.

Transfer tomato mixture to the meat mixture and stir. Simmer sauce, uncovered, over low heat, stirring occasionally, while preparing the pasta.

Bring 1 gallon water and salt to a boil over high heat. Carefully add the pasta, stirring quickly to separate. Cover and return to a boil. Once boiling, uncover and continue to cook until just less than al dente, 5-6 minutes. Drain in colander.

Add pasta to meat sauce and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Add cheese and toss. Serve.
