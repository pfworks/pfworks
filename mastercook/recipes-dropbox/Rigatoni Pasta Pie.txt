  1              pound  rigatoni pasta
  1              pound  ground beef
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  fresh ground pepper
                        spaghetti sauce
                        cooking spray
                        salt
  1                cup  parmesan cheese -- finely grated
  2               cups  mozzarella cheese -- grated
  4             ounces  cream cheese
  15            ounces  ricotta cheese
  2                     egg
  1           teaspoon  basil
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  1                cup  onion
                        spring form pan

Prepare noodles. Drain and run cool water over to make cool enough to handle.

Brown beef and drain excess grease. Add chopped onion and garlic. After about 5 minutes add cream cheese and stir until melted. Add sauce.

Use a small mixing bowl to mix ricotta, Parmesan, basil, oregano and 2 eggs until smooth. Set aside. Tightly pack pasta into pan, standing each piece on end. Use cooking spray on the bottom of the pan first to avoid sticking. Put a ziploc bag inside tall glass and fill with cheese mixture. Close the bag and snip the corner and pipe a small amount into each noodle. Pour sauce over and push down as much as possible.

Top with 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.

Bake at 350 for 20 minutes and then broil until the cheese turns bubbly.
