--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
     1/2           cup  smooth peanut butter
  1         tablespoon  corn syrup
  1              pinch  sea salt
     1/8      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- cut into chunks
  6             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  2             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  4             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
  4              large  egg
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown muscavado sugar -- packed
  2          teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

Bring the cream to a simmer over low heat in a small saucepan. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat and cook, without stirring until amber brown. Slowly whisk in the warm cream until smooth and let cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in the peanut butter, corn syrup, sea salt and 1/8 tspn of vanilla extract until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and let cool until thickened at room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Put a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325. Line a 9x13 baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on narrow ends. Spray with nonstick spray.

Combine the butter, unsweetened chocolate and 2 oz bittersweet chocolate in a medium bowl set over a pot of simmering water. Let chocolate melt over low heat, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, both sugars, vanilla and salt until smooth. Whisk in the melted chocolate mixture until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the flour in 2 additions. Stir in the remaining 4 ounces of chopped bittersweet chocolate.

Scrape half of the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Using a tablespoon, drop dollops of half of the peanut butter caramel every 2 inches over the top of the batter. Carefully add the remaining batter and smooth over the caramel. Smooth the top and dollop the remaining caramel over the top. Use a butter knife to swirl.

Bake until top is set but still soft and edges are puffed and just beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 23-25 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely.

Refrigerate pan about 20 minutes before cutting. Using the foil, lift brownies out of pan. Carefully peel away foil and put on a large cutting board. Cut the brownies into squares.
