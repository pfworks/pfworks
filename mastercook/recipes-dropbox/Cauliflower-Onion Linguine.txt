                        kosher salt
  12            ounces  linguine
  4        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4           cup  panko
     1/2           cup  fried onions -- chopped
  4               cups  cauliflower florets -- roughly chopped
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese -- grated
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- chopped
     1/4           cup  pine nut

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook as directed. Reserve 1 cup water, then drain. Return pasta to pot and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil.

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook about 30 seconds. Add the panko and fried onions and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate; wipe out the skillet.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cauliflower and cook until the edges brown, about 4 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and toast 30 seconds. Add the reserved pasta water and cook until the liquid is reduced by half and the cauliflower is crisp-tender, about 1 more minute. 

Add the pasta, onion mixture and parmesan to the skillet and toss. Season with salt. Top with basil, pine nuts and parmesan.
