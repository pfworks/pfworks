  2                     Ancho or Pasilla chiles -- stemmed, seeded and torn into strips
  1                     New Mexico Red -- stemmed, seeded and torn into strips
  1                     Chile de arbol -- stemmed, seeded and torn into strips
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  yellow onion -- finely diced
  2             cloves  garlic
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
  1           teaspoon  coriander -- toasted and ground
  1              whole  clove -- toasted and ground
  1              whole  star anise -- toasted and ground
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  3        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2          teaspoons  soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1 1/2         pounds  80/20 ground chuck or short rib
  1              quart  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  masa harina
  1         tablespoon  Frank's Red Hot
  1         tablespoon  bourbon
                        kosher salt

Combine all chiles in a medium microwave safe bowl and cover with water. Microwave on full power for 2 minutes. Remove bowl from microwave and allow chiles to soak for 10 minutes. Blend soaked chiles until snooth, adding soaking water as needed to keep texture loose.

Melt butter over medium high heat in Dutch oven. When foaming subsides, add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened but not browned, about 6 minutes. Add ground spices and oregano and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 1.5 minutes. Add tomato paste, soy sauce and sugar and cook, stirring frequently until paste begins to stick to bottom of pan, about 1.5 minutes.

Remove pan from heat and add 2 cups of chicken broth. Scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan with wooden spoon. Add ground beef and break up using whisk until completely broken up. Add remaining chicken stock and return to stovetop and set over medium high heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until simmering. Cover with lid slightly ajar, reduce heat to low, and cook for 75 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Combine masa harina and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Add masa mixture, hot sauce, and bourbon to chili and stir to combine. Bring to a boil and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve.
