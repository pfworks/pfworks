                        pastry cream
  1 1/3           cups  heavy cream
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  table salt
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1           teaspoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into 2 pieces
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        cupcakes
  1 3/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  sugar
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened, cut into 12 pieces
  3              large  egg
     3/4           cup  milk
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
                        chocolate glaze
     3/4           cup  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

For the pastry cream: Heat cream in medium saucepan over medium heat until simmering, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar and salt together in medium bowl. Add cornstarch and whisk until mixture is pale yellow and thick, about 15 seconds.

When cream reaches full simmer, slowly whisk it into yolk mixture. Return to saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thick and glossy, about 1.5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and vanilla. Transfer cream to a small bowl, press plastic wrap directly on surface, and refrigerate until cold and set, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Cupcakes: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350. Spray muffin pan with cooking spray, flour generously, and tap pan.

With electric mixer on low speed, combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a large bowl. Add butter, one piece at a time, and combine until mixture resembles coarse sand. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix until combined. Add milk and vanilla, increase speed to medium, and mix until light, fluffy, and lump free, about 3 minutes.

Fill muffin cups 3/4 full. Bake until done, 18-20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes in pan, then remove and cool completely.

Glaze: Cook cream, corn syrup, chocolate, and vanilla in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. Set aside to cool and thicken for 30 seconds.

Cut cones out of top of cupcakes, fill with 2 tbspns cream, and top with disk. Set cupcakes on wire rack and spoon 2 tbspns of glaze over each one, allowing to drip down the side.
