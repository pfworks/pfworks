--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  pink peppercorn
  2        tablespoons  black peppercorns
  1 1/2    tablespoons  fennel seed
  7             cloves  garlic
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  5             pounds  boneless pork shoulder roast (butt end)
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
  2               cups  chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour

Grind 1/4 cup pink peppercorns with black peppercorns and fennel in grinder, then stir together with garlic, oil and 1 tbspn salt.

Pat pork dry and use paring knife to make 16 1 inch deep slits all over roast. Stuff slits with all but 1 tbspn garlic peppercorn paste, then rub remaining tablespoon all over roast. Put in a small flameproof roasting pan and marinate, chilled, 8 to 24 hours.

Let pork stand at room temperature 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 with rack in middle.

Roast pork, fat side up, until 150, 1.5 to 2 hours. Transfer to cutting board and let rest 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour off all but 1 tbspn fat from pan. Add vermouth to pan and boil, scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes. Stir in broth, any juices from cutting board, and remaining 2 tbspns pink peppercorns and boil until reduced to 1.5 cups about 5 minutes.

Knead together butter and flour, then whisk into sauce and boil, whisking constantly, until just slightly thickened, 2 minutes.

Serve pork with sauce.
