--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  sweet italian sausage
  1              pound  red seedless grapes -- halved
  1              large  onion -- sliced thin
     1/4           cup  water
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground pepper
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
  1         tablespoon  fresh oregano -- chopped
  2          teaspoons  balsamic vinegar
  2        tablespoons  fresh mint -- chopped

Heat oil in 12 inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Arrange sausage links in pan and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Tilt skillet and carefully remove excess fat with paper towel. Distribute grapes and onion over and around sausages. Add water and immediately cover. Cook, turning sausages once, until they are 160 and onions and grapes have softened, about 10 minutes.

Transfer sausages to paper towel lined plate and loosely tent with foil. Return skillet to med-high heat and stir salt and pepper into grape-onion mixture. Spread grape onion mixture in even layer in skillet and cook, without stirring, until well-browned, 1.5 to 2 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until grape-onion mixture is deeply browned and has jam consistency, about 2 minutes longer. Reduce heat to medium, stir in wine and oregano, and cook, scraping up and browned bits, until wine is reduced by half, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir in vinegar.

Arrange sausages on serving platter and spoon grape-onion mixture over top. Sprinkle with mint and serve.
