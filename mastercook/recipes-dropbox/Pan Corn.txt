  4             slices  thick cut bacon
  2                     leeks -- bottom third sliced into rounds
  4               ears  sweet corn -- kernels shaved off cob
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Cook the bacon in a heavy frying pan until it's crisp. Transfer to a rack or paper towel to drain, then chop when it's cool. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat from the pan and add the leeks, cooking them gently until soft. Add the kernels and the bacon. Allow the corn to cook for a few minutes, the fresher the corn, the less cooking. Season with salt and pepper.
