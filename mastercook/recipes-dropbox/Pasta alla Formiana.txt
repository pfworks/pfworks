                        butter
  28            ounces  crushed tomatoes
  1              clove  garlic -- coarsely chopped
     1/2         pound  mezze penne or other small pasta
     1/3           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  dried oregano
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  5                     very ripe extra large beefsteak tomatoes -- 1/2" slices

Put an oven rack in center of oven. Preheat to 450. Butter an 8x8 glass baking dish.

In a food processor, blend together the crushed tomatoes and garlic. Pour into a medium bowl and add the uncooked pasta, 1/3 cup olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Toss until well coated.

Line the botton and sides of baking dish with tomato slices. Pour the pasta mixture into the pan and spread evenly. Arrange the remaining slices in an overlapping layer on top of the pasta, making sure it is completely covered. Drizzle with oil. Bake until the tomatoes are slightly crispy and the pasta is cooked, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool 5 minutes before eating.
