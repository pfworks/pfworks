Fold to mix and let stand 20 minutes.

Place a large skillet over medium heat. Add just enough oil to coat bottom of skillet. When skillet is hot, pour corn batter, about 1/8 cup per cake. Cook on one side for about 1.5 minutes or until brown. Turn and cook until middles of cakes no longer appear wet. Remove cakes to warm platter and repeat to make 8 cakes. Place 2 cakes, edges overlapping in center of each of 4 warm plates. Spoon 2 tbspns of Diablo sauce on and around cakes and serve immediately.
