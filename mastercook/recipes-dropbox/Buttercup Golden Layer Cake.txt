--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  2               cups  sugar
  4              large  eggs -- room temp
  1                cup  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour
  1 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350.

Grease and lightly flour three 9x2 inch round cake pans. Line the bottom with wax paper.

In a large bowl, on the med speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix the milk and vanilla together. Combine the flours and add in two parts, alternating with the milk and vanilla mixture, beating well after each addition.

Divide the batter among the prepared pans. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on wire rack.

If you're making cupcakes, line 2 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake papers. Spoon the batter into the cups about 3/4 full. Bake until tops spring back when lightly touched, about 20-22 minutes. Remove cupcakes from pan and cool completely.

When cake has cooled, ice between layers, then ice top and sides of cake.
