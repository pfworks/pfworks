  2               cups  onion -- chopped
     3/4           cup  carrot -- chopped
     3/4           cup  celery -- chopped
  6              large  fresh thyme sprigs
  6              large  garlic clove -- chopped
  2                     bay leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  2               cups  dry red wine
  28            ounces  plum tomatoes in juice, chopped -- juice reserved
  1 1/4         pounds  ziti pasta
  2               cups  whole milk mozzarella cheese -- grated
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese -- freshly grated

Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over med-high heat. Add pancetta and saute until brown and crisp. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to bowl. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper. Add half of pork to drippings in pot; saute until brown, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a bowl with pancetta. Repeat with remaining pork. Add sausage to the same pot. Saute until no longer pink, breaking up with the back of fork, about 5 minutes. Add onions, carrots, celery, thyme, garlic, bay leaves, and red pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low; saute until veges are tender, about 10 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil, scraping up browned bits. Add pancetta and pork with any juices; boil 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with juice. Cover and cook until pork in very tender, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer and stirring occasionally, about 2 hours.

Uncover pot, tilt to 1 side and spoon off fat from surface. Gently press pieces with back of fork to break up meat coarsely. Season ragu to taste with salt and pepper. 

Preheat oven to 400. Butter 15x10x2 glass baking dish or other 4 quart baking dish. Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally. Drain pasta, mix into ragu. Season to taste with salt and pepper; transfer to dish. Sprinkle with both cheeses. Bake until heated through and golden, about 20 minutes.
