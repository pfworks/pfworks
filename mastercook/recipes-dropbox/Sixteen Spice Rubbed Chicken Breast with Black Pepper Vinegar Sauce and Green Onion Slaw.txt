  4                     8 oz chicken breasts -- skin on
                        Black Pepper Vinegar Sauce
     1/4           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  2          teaspoons  honey
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     3/4      teaspoon  black pepper -- coarsely ground

Combine sauce ingredients and puree in a blender until smooth.

Combine green onions, vinegar, honey, chiles, mayonnaise, oil, salt and pepper to taste in a blender and blend until emulsified.

Combine the cabbage, red onion and poppy seeds in a bowl, add the dressing and stir until combined. Fold in the cilantro and season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for up to an hour.

Heat grill to high.

Stir together the ancho powder, pasilla powder, cumin, coriander, ginger, brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, fennel, chile de arbol, 2 tablespoons salt, black pepper and cayenne in a small bowl.

Brush both sides of the breasts with the oil and season with salt. Rub the top side of each breast with a few tablespoons of the rub and place on the grill, rub side down. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the breasts over and continue grilling until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes longer.

Remove chicken from grill and drizzle with black pepper sauce. Tent with foil and let rest 5 minutes. Serve with slaw.
