  1              pound  cottage cheese
  2              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  3             ounces  parmesan cheese -- grated
                        salt
  1              pound  ziti pasta
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  5             cloves  garlic -- minced
  29            ounces  tomato sauce
  14 1/2        ounces  diced tomato
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  fresh basil -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh basil -- chopped
                        pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  cornstarch
  1                cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  low-fat mozarella -- cut into 1/4" pieces

Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350. Whisk the cottage cheese, eggs, and 1 cup of the parmesan together in a medium bowl; set aside. Bring 4 quarts of water to boil in a large dutch oven over high heat. Stir in 1 tbspn salt and the pasta; cook, stirring often, until the pasta is just shy of al dente, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain the pasta and leave in colander. (do not wash pot)

Meanwhile, heat the oil and garlic in a 12" skillet over medium heat until the garlic is fragrant but not brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and oregano and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Off the heat, stir in 1/2 cup of the basil and the sugar, then season with the salt and pepper to taste.

Stir the cornstarch into the cream in a small bowl; transfer the mixture to the now empty pot set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and add the cottage cheese mixture, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, and 3/4 cup of the mozzarella, then stir to combine. Add pasta and stir to coat thouroughly.

Transfer pasta mixture to a 13x9 baking dish and spread the remaining sauce evenly over the pasta. Sprinkle the remaining 3/4 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup parmesan over the top. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes.

Remove foil and continue to cook until the cheese is bubbling and beginning to brown, about 30 minutes longer. Let cool for 20 minutes. Sprinkle with 2 tbspn basil and serve.
