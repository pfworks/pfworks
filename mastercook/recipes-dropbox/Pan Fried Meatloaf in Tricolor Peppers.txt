     1/2         pound  ground pork
  2             slices  white bread -- cubed
  28            ounces  crushed tomatoes with basil
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                     egg
  1              small  onion -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  sage leaves -- chopped
  8                     whole sage leaves
  3             dashes  worcestershire sauce

Preheat oven to 400.

Remove core and seeds from peppers. Slice into 1 inch rings and place on nonstick baking sheet. You should get about 3 rings per pepper. In a large bowl mix together beef, pork, bread, 1/2 cup of the tomatoes, garlic, egg, onion, chopped sage, worcestire sauce, hot sauce and season with salt and pepper. Press meat mixture evenly into pepper rings. In a skillet over med-high heat, add oil. Saute rings on both sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add remaining tomatoes to skillet and bake until cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 inch oil in a saucepan until 325. Drop sage leaves and fry until golden, 1-2 minutes. Garnish meatloaf with fried sage.
