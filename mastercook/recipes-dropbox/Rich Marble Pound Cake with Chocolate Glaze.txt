--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  cake flour
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
     1/2           cup  natural cocoa powder
  6        tablespoons  water
  1 1/2           cups  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vanilla extract
  5              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  whole milk
                        bittersweet chocolate glaze
  3             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- coarsely chopped
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract

Glaze: Place the chocolate in the bowl of a food processor and process until just finely ground.

In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a boil. Remove from the heat and add the chocolate to the pan. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the glaze is smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Transfer to a small bowl. Cover the surface of the glaze with plastic wrap and let cool for about 10 minutes before using.

Cake: Position the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325. Grease and dust 10" bundt pan.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup of the sugar, the cocoa powder, and water until smooth; set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer with paddle, beat the butter at medium speed until very creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat in remaining 2 cups sugar. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until the mixture is well blended and light, about 4 minutes. At medium speed, beat in the vanilla, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients in three additinos, alternating with half the milk and mixing until just blended.

Add 3 cups of the batter to the cocoa mixture and stir until blended. Spoon one-third of the reminaing batter into the prepared pan and smooth. Sppon one third of the chocolate batter over the plain batter and smooth it. Repeat, ending with chocolate batter.

Bake the cake for 60-70 minutes, until a cake tester comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes.

Invert cake on rack and cool completely.

Place the cake on the rack, on a wax or foil lined baking sheet. Slowly pour glaze over top of cake, letting it drip down the sides. Let the glaze set for 30 minutes.
