--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             cloves  garlic
  16                    guajillo chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  2        tablespoons  lard or vegetable oil
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  black pepper -- freshly ground
     1/8      teaspoon  cumin -- toasted and ground
  3               cups  beef broth
  1           teaspoon  honey
                        salt and pepper
  6                     new york strip steaks -- 1" thick
  6        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped

Roast the unpeeled garlic, wrapped in foil, in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes; cool and peel. Wipe the dried chiles with a damp cloth, discard the stems and seeds, and tear into pieces. Heat the lard or oil in a heavy saucepan and fry the chiles in the hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes, stirring to prevent scorching. Remove them to a bowl and cover with boiling water, allow to soften, 20 to 30 minutes. Put the chiles in a a blender with about a cup of the soaking liquid and the garlic, oregano, pepper, and cumin and blend to a puree. Reheat the oil in which the chiles were fried, and pour the puree into the oil. Saute the puree, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef broth and honey and simmer the sauce over a low flame 45 minutes to an hour. Salt and pepper to taste. Prepare grill or broiler, and cook the steaks to med-rare. Brush with sauce and grill or broil to your liking. Drizzle with more sauce and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Pass additional sauce on the side.
