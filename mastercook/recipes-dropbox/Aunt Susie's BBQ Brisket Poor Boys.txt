  5             pounds  first cut beef brisket
     1/2           cup  Aunt Susie's BBQ Rub
  3               cups  Aunt Susie's BBQ Mop
                        hamburger buns

The day before serving, rub both sides of the brisket with Rub. Wrap tightly in plastic, and refrigerate overnight.

About 4 hours before serving, preheat oven to 250 degrees.

Place brisket in a large oven proof pan, and pour the Mop over the meat. Cover with foil and cook for 2-2.5 hours, or until tender. Remove from the oven and cool slightly. Place on a cutting board and slice about 1/4" thick. Re-form the sliced brisket back into the pan. Spoon the pan's sauce over the top. Cover and cook 1 hour longer, basting occasionally with the sauce. Serve the sliced brisket in its sauce on buns.
