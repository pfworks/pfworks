--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  small red bliss potatoes (18) -- scrubbed
  6        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  fresh thyme -- chopped
                        kosher salt and black pepper

Adjust oven racks to top and bottom positions and preheat oven to 500. Arrange potatoes on rimmed baking sheet, pour 3/4 cup water into baking sheet and tightly wrap with foil. Cook on bottom rack until knife slips in and out easily, 25-30 minutes. Remove foil and cool 10 minutes. Blot away any water.

Drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over potatoes and roll to coat. Space potatoes evenly on baking sheet and place second sheet on top; press down firmly, flattening potatoes to 1/3 to 1/2 inch. Sprinkle with thyme and season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Roast on top rack for 15 minutes. Transfer to bottom rack and roast until well browned, 20-30 minutes. Serve.
