  2          teaspoons  bourbon
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Mix rub together.

Rub brisket all over with rub. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before continuing.

Preheat oven to 325. Heat 1 tbspn oil in a large, wide pot over high heat. Add brisket, fat side down. Cook undisturbed until well browned, 5-6 minutes. Turn brisket over and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a plate. Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 tablespoon of oil. Add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is slightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add broth and all remaining ingredients. Bring liquid to a simmer. Return brisket to pot. Cover and transfer to oven.

Braise until brisket is very tender to the touch but still holds its shape, about 4 1/2 hours. Using a large spatula, transfer, fat side up, to a plate. Strain braising liquid into a large bowl. Return liquid to pot, bring to a simmer, and cook until reduced to 2 cups, about 15 minutes.. Score fat side of brisket by cutting a crosshatch pattern of 1/4" deep slits spaced 1/2" apart. Return brisket, fat side up. to pot with reduced liquid.

Transfer 1/4 cup braising liquid to a blender. Add jam and bourbon and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat broiler, spread 3-4 tablespoons glaze on top of brisket with back of a spoon. Broil brisket in pot until browned and glazed, 4-5 minutes.

Transfer brisket to cutting board. Slice against grain. Ladle braising liquid over and drizzle with glaze.
