--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  garlic cloves (4-5 heads)
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh thyme
  2                     onions -- chopped
  1                     habanero chile -- stemmed and seeded, chopped
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        juice of 1 lime
  2               cups  white vinegar
  4             pounds  boneless pork leg or shoulder -- 1" cubes
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil

Combine all the ingredients except the pork and oil and puree in a blender in batches until smooth. Pour the mixture over the pork and marinate, covered, in a nometallic bowl in the refrigerator for at least 2 days and preferably one week.

Drain the pork, discard the marinade and pat it dry. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat and fry the pork cubes, a few at a time, turning often until they are browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Add more oil for each batch if necessary.

Drain the pork on paper towels and serve with rice.

You can also simmer the marinade until thick and serve it as sauce.
