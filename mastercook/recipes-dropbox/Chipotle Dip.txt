  2               cups  red wine vinegar
  6              dried  chipotle chiles -- stems and seeds removed
  1                cup  brown sugar -- packed
                        salt
     1/3           cup  olive oil
  2             medium  onion -- chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  dried mexican oregano
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  sour cream
  1                cup  mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice

Place the water, vinegar, chiles, brown sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to boil then reduce the heat to low, and cook until the chiles rehydrate and the peels are easily loosened, about 20 minutes. Remove chiles and peel off skin. Puree in blender with 2 tablespoons of the liquid and reserve.

In another saucepan, combine the olive oil, onions, garlic, salt, thyme, oregano and bay leaf and cook over medium heat, stirring well, for 5 minutes. Drain off excess oil and remove bay leaf.

In a bowl, mix together the pureed chiles, onion mixture, sour cream, mayonnaise, and lemon juice.
