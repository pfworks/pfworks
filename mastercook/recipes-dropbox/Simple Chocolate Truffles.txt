                        ganache
  12            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- finely chopped
     1/3           cup  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  light corn syrup
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
  1 1/2    tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into 8 pieces and softened
                        cocoa coating
  1                cup  dutch-process cocoa powder
     1/4           cup  confectioner's sugar

Ganache: Lightly coat 8 inch baking dish with vegetable oil spray.

Make parchment sling by folding 2 long sheets of parchment so that they are as wide as 8 inch baking pan. Lay sheets of parchment in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra parchment hanging over the side of the pan. Push parchment into corners and up sides of pan, fold overhand over edges of pan and crease.

Microwave chocolate in bowl at 50% power, stirring occasionally, until mostly melted and few small chocolate pieces remain, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes. Place cream in measuring cup and microwave until warm to touch, about 30 seconds. Stirn corn syrup, vanilla, and salt into cream. Pour cream mixture over chocolate, cover bowl, and let stand for 3 minutes.

With wooden spoon, start at center of bowland gently stir chocolate mixture, working in liquid from around edges of bowl until mixture is glossy, thick, and pudding-like. Add butter and stir until completely combined. Transfer mixture to prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap, and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.

Coating: Remove baking dish from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, sift cocoa powder and sugar thorugh fine-mesh strainer into large bowl. Sift mixture again into large shallow cake pan.

Using parchment overhang, lift ganache out of pan and place it upside down on cutting board. Peel off parchment and re-invert square. Using chef's knife, cut into 1 inch squares, running knife under hot water and wiping dry between slices if it starts to stick. Gently squish corners of each piece to round edges slightly. Dust hands with some cocoa mixture and roll 4 rounded pieces into balls. Place balls in cocoa mixture and roll evenly to coat. Transfer coated balls to strainer and tap over cake pan to loosen any excess. Transfer to large airtight container and repeat. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours to 1 week. Let truffles sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.
