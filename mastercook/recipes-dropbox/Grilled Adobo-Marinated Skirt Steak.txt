                        pasilla guajillo adobo
  6                     pasilla chiles -- stemmed, seeded, deveined and slit open
  8                     guajillo chiles -- stemmed, seeded, deveined and slit open
     1/4           cup  distilled white vinegar
     1/4           cup  light Mexican beer
     1/2           cup  white onion -- chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- peeled
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  mexican oregano
  5              whole  cloves
                        steak
  2             pounds  skirt steak -- cut into 4 8-9 inch pieces
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  adobo from above
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Heat a comal, griddle or heavy skillet over medium-low heat, and toast the chiles 2-3 at a time, turning them over and pressing down on them until fragrant, about 1 minute per batch. Soak the chiles in enough cold water to cover until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain and discard water.

Put the vinegar and beer in the blender with the chiles and the remaining adobo ingredients. Blend until smooth, at least 3 minutes, adding a little water if necessary to puree. Process through a sieve for a silky texture. 

Pat the steaks dry, season with salt, then coat generously with adobo. Marinate in the refirgerator for 1 to 2 hours.

Heat a grill or grill pan over med-high heat. Lightly oil the grill or grill pan and cook the steaks, 3 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.
