  1                     poblano pepper -- stemmed seeded and flattened
  1                     store roasted chicken
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1              pinch  cayenne
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
     1/2                lime -- juiced
  1              piece  kosher salt
     1/2           cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  cilantro -- finely chopped
  4              small  corn tortilla
     1/4           cup  cheddar cheese
                        salsa

Position an oven rack close to the broiler, and heat the broiler. Put the peppers skin side up on a baking sheet and broil until blackened. Transfer the peppers to a small bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it cool.

Reduce oven to 400.

Remove skin from legs, thighs, and wings of the chicken and shred the meat; you should have about 1.5 cups. In a medium bowl, combine olive oil, cumin, cayenne, half the garlic, and the lime juice. Season with salt. Add chicken to bowl and toss to coat.

Remove skin from peppers and chop finely.

In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, onion, the other half of garlic, the cilantro and the chopped peppers.

Put the tortillas on a baking sheet. Divide the chicken among the tortillas leaving a little space around the edges. Top with sour cream mixture and cheese. Bake until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and salsa.
