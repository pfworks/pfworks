--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2          teaspoons  tamarind pulp
  3        tablespoons  very warm water
  3          teaspoons  whole coriander seeds
  3                     shallot -- peeled and coarsely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled and coarsely chopped
  1               tspn  ground turmeric
     1/2          inch  fresh ginger -- peeled and coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  palm sugar, finely chopped or dark brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  peanut oil
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
                        satay
  1              pound  well-marbelized flank or skirt steak, at least 3/4" thick
  20                    sharp, thin 10" bamboo skewers, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes and drained

To make the marinade, place the tamarind pulp in a small nonreactive bowl and mix it with 3 tbspns of very warm water. Let the pulp rest until it softens, 10-15 minutes. Squeeze and massage the pulp through your fingers, loosening the fruit's pulp from the shiny black seeds, brittle brown skin shards, and sinewy bits of string. With your fingers, remove all the solid pieces from the liquid and discard them; all that remains is a thick caramel colored extract. Set aside.

Place the coriander seeds in a small food processor. Pulse into the coriander is well ground and dusty, about 2 minutes.

Add the tamarind extract, shallots, garlic, turmeric, ginger, palm sugar, oil, and salt to the food processor. Pulse until you have a smooth paste the consistency of creamy mashed potatoes. Tranfer to a non-reactive bowl large enough to hold beef.

Slice the beef into long, 1/4" thick strips against the grain of the meat. The piece should be no wider than 1 inch.

Add sliced beef to bowl and combine it well with the marinade, making sure that every piece is coated. Allow to marinate at room temperature for 1-2 hours.

Thread the beef onto skewers, weaving every 1/4". Use 1-4 pieces to each skewer.

Cook on grill until cooked through and a few black spots appear.

To cook in broiler, preheat broiler for 5 minutes and position rack 3 inches from heat. Line sheet pan with foil. Place skewers on foil so the meat is in center of pan and skewers hang over the edge. Broil for 5-6 minutes, and flip over for 5-6 minutes more.
