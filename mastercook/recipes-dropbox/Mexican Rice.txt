--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  canola or vegetable oil
  1 1/2           cups  long grain white rice
  1                cup  white onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  garlic -- minced
  1 1/4           cups  canned crushed tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  red chile powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1 3/4           cups  water
                        optional ingredients
     3/4           cup  baby frozen peas
     3/4           cup  corn kernels
     1/2           cup  roasted poblano -- diced

Heat oil in saucepan over medium high heat and saute the rice until is it opaque and golden, about 5-7 minutes.

Add the onions and garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, chile powder, salt and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until water is absorbed.

Turn off the heat, uncover the rice, and stir to incorporate added ingredients, if any. Replace the lid and let the rice steam for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.
