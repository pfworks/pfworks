--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
  2 1/2      teaspoons  new mexican red chile powder
  2               cans  Pillsbury grands buttermilk biscuit -- 16.3 oz each
     1/2           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  cayenne

Preheat oven to 350. Coat a 10-in Bundt pan with cooking spray. In a medium bowl, add sugar, cinnamon and chile powder, and mix to combine. Remove biscuits from container and cut each biscuit into quarters. Add half the biscuits into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and, using your hands, evenly coat the pieces.

In a microwave-safe bowl, melt butter. Add brown sugar and cayenne pepper, and mix to combine. Pour half of the brown sugar mixture into the bottom of the pan. Arrange the coated biscuits in rows on top of the brown sugar mixture, which should result in 2 to 3 rows.

Add remaining biscuit pieces to the leftover sugar-cinnamon mixture, and coat. Arrange the pieces in the pan, on top of the existing layers. Pour remaining brown sugar mixture over the top. Place in oven and cook until top if puffy and golden brown, about 35 to 40 minutes, making sure that center is no longer doughy. Remove from oven, and cool in pan for 10 to 15 minutes. Put onto serving plate and serve warm.
