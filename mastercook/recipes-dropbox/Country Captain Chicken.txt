--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  bone-in, skin on chicken pieces -- breasts halved, legs quartered into thighs and drumsticks
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     onion -- finely chopped
  1                     red bell pepper -- seeded and chopped fine
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  curry powder
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  28            ounces  petit diced tomatoes
  1                     granny Smith apple -- cored and diced
  2          teaspoons  lime juice

Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Cook half of chicken until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining chicken. When chicken is cool enough to handle, peel and discard skin.

Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from pot. Cook onions and bell pepper, covered, until softened, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic, tomato paste, curry powder, flour and sugar and cook until fragrant and color deepens, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and apple and bring to a boil.

Return chicken and juices to pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until white meat registers 160F and dark 170F, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Serve.
