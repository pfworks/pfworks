--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  chilled heavy cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1                cup  cream cheese -- softened
  12                    chocolate graham crackers -- broken into squares
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon

In a medium bowl, add 2 cups cream and 6 tablespoons sugar and whisk, using a hand mixer until soft peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. Slowly add cream cheese and beat until fully incorporated.

Spread 1.5 cups cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a springform pan and arrange a layer of grham crackers on top. Spread another 1.5 cups and another layer of crackers. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture on top, making sure it is smooth. Cover with plastic wrap, making contact, and freeze until firm, about 2 hours. Defrost in fridge for 6 hours. 

Place remaining crackers in food processor and grind until you have fine crumbs. Using hand mixer, whip the remaining 1 cup cream until stiff peaks form and add cinnamon and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.

Remove plastic wrap and sides of the pan and frost all over with cinnamon cream. Sprinkle the top with the crumbs. Serve cold.
