--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  bacon
     1/2           cup  butter
     3/4           cup  packed dark brown sugar
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
     3/4           cup  white sugar
  2          teaspoons  cinnamon
  2                     16 oz refrigerated biscuit dough, cut into quarters

Preheat oven to 350. Coat the inside of a 9 inch bundt pan with spray.

Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Crumble and remove extra fat.

Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat; stir in brown sugar and maple syrup. Bring mixture to a boil; cook and stir until mixture begins to foam, about 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat.

Mix sugar and cinnamon in a resealable plastic bag; add 6-8 biscuit pieces at a time and shake until well coated. Pour any remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture into brown sugar mixture. Place saucepan over medium heat and cook and stir until sugar dissolves, 2-3 minutes.

Sprinkle 1/4 of the bacon pieces in the bottom of the pan, pour in about 1/4 brown sugar mixture. Arrange 1 layer of biscuits in pan, sprinjle in 1/4 of the bacon pieces. Drizzle about 1/4 of the brown sugar mixture over biscuits. Repeat, ending with drizzle.

Bake about 35 minutes. Allow to cool 10-20 minutes. Invert onto plate.
