  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3 1/2         pounds  chicken -- trimmed and cut into 8 pieces
  5                     thick smoked bacon slices -- coarsely chopped
  20             small  pearl onion -- peeled
  3             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1                cup  low sodium chicken broth
  1                cup  red wine
  2        tablespoons  cognac or brandy
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

Stir in broth, wine, cognac, tomato paste and thyme .Return chicken and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until chicken is fork tender, about 30 minutes.

Remove chicken with a slotted spoon to a platter. In a small bowl, mix flout and remaining 2 tbspns butter to form a paste. Add to cooking liquid, stirring until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.

Return chicken and simmer for 5 minutes longer. Transfer chicken and most of the onions to a warm platter. Stir sauce and pour over chicken, and sprinkle with parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
