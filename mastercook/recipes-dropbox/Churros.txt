                        cinnamon sugar
  1                cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
                        churro batter
  1                cup  whole milk
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  2          teaspoons  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt
  1                cup  all purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
                        canola oil

For cinnamon sugar: Whisk all ingredients in bowl to blend.

For batter: Bring 1st 4 ingredients to boil in heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves and butter melts. Reduce heat to med-low. Add flour; stir vigorously with wooden spoon until shiny dough mass forms, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl; cool 5 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat in eggs, 1 at a time; continue beating until smooth, shiny, sticky paste forms. Can be made 2 hours ahead. Cover and let stand at room temperature.

Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat to 350. Working in batches, spoon batter into pastry bag fitted with large star tip. Pipe batter into hot oil in 3.5 - 4 inch long ribbons and allow batter to slide into oil. Fry churros until brown and cooked through in center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels. Cool 5 minutes, then toss in cinnamon sugar to coat.
