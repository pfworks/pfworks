     1/2      teaspoon  ground oregano

Heat heavy large skillet over medium heat; add chiles. Using spatula, press down on chiles until beginning to soften and darken, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to work surface; cool. Cut chiles in half lengthwise; remove seeds and stems and discard. Place in bowl. Add enough boiling water to cover; let stand until chiles softwn, about 1 hour.

Drain chiles, reserving 1/2 cup liquid. Place chiles in blender. Add vinegar, garlic, cloves, oregano, cinnamon, thyme, and liquid. Blend until smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Arrange pork in shallow dish. Spoon paste over pork. Turn to coat. Cover and chill at least 6 hours.

Heat oil in large non-stick pot over medium heat. Remove pork from marinade. Season with salt and pepper. Add pork to skillet, cook until brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
