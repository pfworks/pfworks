  1               loaf  ciabatta bread
  1 1/2    tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic
  1                     tomato -- halved crosswise
                        salt and freshly ground pepper

Preheat a grill pan over med-high heat. Slice ciabatta in half lengthwise, then cut each half into one inch slices. In batches as needed, grill the ciabatta slices cut side down until they are golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Working quickly, drizzle the toasted sides with extra virgin olive oil. Rub the garlic cloves over the grilled bread, then rub the cut side of the tomato over the grilled bread. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve warm.
