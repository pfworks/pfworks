Saute chopped bacon and chile de arbol in heavy large saucepan over medium heat until bacon is crisp. Add chopped onion and garlic cloves; saute until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add W-sauce and crushed peppercorns; stir 1 minute. Add peaches and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add orange juice, ketchup, lemon juice and hot pepper sauce. Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon thickly, stirring often, about 30 minutes.

Strain sauce into medium bowl, pressing enough liquid and solids through strainer to yield 2 cups sauce. Discard solids. Season with salt and pepper.

Brush pork tenderloins with olive oil to coat. Arrange pork on rimmed baking sheet. Mix black pepper, kosher salt, and garlic powder in small bowl to blend. Sprinkle seasonig mixture all over pork. 

Prepare BBQ. Transfer 1/2 cup sauce to bowl for basting and pour remaining sauce in saucepan. Grill tenderloins until brown and 140, turning occasinoally, about 18 minutes. Brush pork all over with sauce. Grill pork until glazed, turning and brushing with more sauce, about 3 minuters longer. Transfer pork to cutting board, let stand 10 minutes.

Rewarm sauce in pan. Cut pork crosswise on slight diagonal into 1/2" thick slices. Arrange slices on platter and drizzle with sauce. Serve with remaining sauce.
