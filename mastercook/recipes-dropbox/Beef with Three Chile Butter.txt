  2                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed, seeded thinly sliced
  2                     dried ancho chiles -- stemmed, seeded thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  butter
  3                     shallot -- chopped
  2                     chipotle chiles from can -- drained, stemmed, seeded, sliced
  1                cup  water
  2        tablespoons  fresh chives -- chopped
			
  3             pounds  beef tenderloin roast
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  fresh parsley -- chopped

Heat large skillet over medium high heat. Add guajillo and ancho chile slices. Toast until fragrant and beginning to darken, stirring often, about 30 seconds. Add butter, shallots, and chipotle chiles. Stir just until chiles are coated with butter and shallots begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup water and simmer until dried chiles are soft and all water had evaporated, about 15 minutes. Mix in chives; season with salt.

Preheat oven to 450. Coat beef with 3 tablespoons oil, salt and pepper and then parsley. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in large ovenproof skillet over high heat. Add beef and sear until brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer skillet with beef to oven. Roast until 125, about 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.

Cut beef into 1/2" slices. Spoon chile butter over and serve.
