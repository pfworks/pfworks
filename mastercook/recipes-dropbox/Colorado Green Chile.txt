--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  boneless pork butt roast -- 1 in pieces
                        salt
  2             pounds  anaheim chiles -- stemmed, halved lengthwise and seeded
  3                     jalapeno chiles
  14 1/2        ounces  diced tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  2                     onion -- finely chopped
  8             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  cumin -- ground
     1/4           cup  flour
  4               cups  chicken broth
                        cayenne pepper
                        lime wedge

Combine pork, 1/2 cup water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in Dutch oven over medium heat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover, increase heat to medium-high, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until liquid evaporates and pork browns in its own fat, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer pork to bowl and set aside.

Meanwhile, adjust 1 oven rack to lowest position and srcond rack 6 inches from broiler. Heat broiler. Line rimmed baking sheet with foil and spray with vegetable oil. Arrange Anaheims, skin side up, and jalepenos in single layer on prepared sheet. Place sheet on upper rack and broil until chiles are mostly blackened and soft, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating sheet and flipping jalepenos half way through. Place chiles in bowl and cover. Let cool for 5 minutes. Heat oven to 325.

Remove skins from Anaheims. Chop half of Anaheims into 1/2 inch pieces and transfer to bowl. Process remaining in food processor until smooth. Transfer to bowl with chopped Anaheims. Pulse tomatoes and juice in food processor until coarsely ground, about 4 pulses. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Stir in broth, Anaheims, tomatoes, and pork with any juices and bring to a simmer, scraping up browned bits. Cover pot, transfer to lower oven rack, and cook until pork is tender, 1 to 1.25 hours.

Stem and sees jalapenos. Finely chop and stir into chili. Season with salt, cayenne and jalapeno seeds. Serve with lime wedges.
