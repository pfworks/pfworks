--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        steak
  1         tablespoon  unsweetened cocoa powder
  2          teaspoons  sweet paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  smoked paprika
  1           teaspoon  light brown sugar -- packed
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        kosher salt
  3                     1-lb NY strip steaks -- 1.5" thick
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        gravy
  4             strips  bacon -- diced
  1                     leek (white and light green parts) -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  whiskey
  3               cups  chicken broth
  2                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
                        kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

Make the steak: Mix the cocoa powder, both paprikas, brown sugar, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt; rub on the steak and bring to room temperature, 30 minutes.

Make the gravy: Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring, until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove to paper towels with a slotted spoon; set aside. Add the leek to the drippings and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Remove the skillet from the heat. Add the whiskey, then return to medium heat; if the alcohol ignites, let the flames die out. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bay leaves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until the mixture is reduced by one-quarter, about 8 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the gravy coats a spoon, about 7 minutes. Stir in the butter, reserved bacon and parsley; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter; when it melts, add the steak and sear until a dark crust forms, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Season with salt. Slice and serve with the gravy.
