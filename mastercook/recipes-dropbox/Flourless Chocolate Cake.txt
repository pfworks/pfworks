--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  semisweer or bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  fine salt
  6              large  eggs -- room temp
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
                        powdered sugar or cocoa powder for dusting
                        Really Vanilly Whipped Cream

Preheat oven to 325. Butter and flour a 9x2 springform pan.

Put the chocolate, butter and salt in a large microwave safe bowl. Melt in the microwave on 75% power for 2 minutes. Stir and microwave again until completely melted, about 2 minutes more. Alternatively, put the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer, and set the bowl on the pan without touching the water. Stir until melted.

Beat the eggs and sugar with a handheld mixer until light and thickened, about 8 to 10 minutes. Fold the melted chocolate into the whipped eggs until evenly combined.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick comes out wet but not gooey, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Remove cake from oven and set on a rack.

When ready to serve, remove ring from mold. Dust cake with powder and serve with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
