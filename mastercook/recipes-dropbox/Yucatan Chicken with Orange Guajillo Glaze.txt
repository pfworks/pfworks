                        Adobo Rub
  4             pounds  chicken -- backbone removed
                        sauce
  2                     dried guajillo chiles -- stemmed and seeded
     1/3           cup  boiling water
                        finely grated zest of 1 orange
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
     3/4           cup  apple cider vinegar
     1/4           cup  light corn syrup
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  honey
     1/2                mango -- peeled and chopped, plus slices for serving
     1/4           cup  fresh ginger -- chopped
  1                     habanero chile -- coarsely chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
                        salt
                        vegetable oil

On a large, rimmed baking sheet, flatten chicken by pressing on breast bone. Sprinkle all over with adobo rub. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Bring chicken to room temperature before grilling.

In a glass measuring cup, cover the guajillo chiles with boiling water. Cover and let stand until softened, about 15 minutes.

In a medium saucepan, combine the orange zest and juice with the vinegar, corn syrup, brown sugar, honey, chopped mango, ginger, habanero and coriander. Add the guajillos and liquid and bring to a boil. Boil over moderately high heat until reduced by halr, about 7 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a blender and puree. Scrape the puree back into the saucepan and simmer over moderate heat until reduced to 1.5 cups, about 15 minutes. Season with salt.

Put chicken on grill skin side down. Grill until charred, about 7 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook until charred on other side, about 5 more minutes. Turn off half the heat or rake coals to one side, away from chicken. Cover and grill over indirect heat, turning halfway through, until 160, about 1 hour.

Brush half of sauce all over chicken. Flip chicken and set it over direct heat. Grill until richly glazed, about 1 minute. Turn the chicken skin side up and grill until glazed, about 1 minute longer. Let chicken rest for 15 minutes. Serve with remaining sauce and mango slices.
