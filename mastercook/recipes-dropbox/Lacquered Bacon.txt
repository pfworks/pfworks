--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  mango chutney -- large chunks chopped
     1/4           cup  apple juice
  2        tablespoons  brown mustard
  1         tablespoon  cider vinegar
  12            slices  thick bacon

Preheat oven to 350. Stir the chutney, juice, mustard, and vinegar together in a small bowl. Arrange the bacon in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake the bacon until it begins to look opaque and the fat begins to render, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour off any accumulated drippings. Turn over the bacon and brush about 1/2 the glaze on the bacon. Return to oven and cook for 3-4 minutes longer. Remove from oven and turn the bacon over again. Brush with the remaining glaze and return it to oven for 3-5 minutes, until well browned and firm.
