--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  dried thyme
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried sage
  6             cloves  garlic -- minced
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     4-6 lb pork loin roast

Preheat oven to 350.

Mix together thyme, sage, garlic, salt, pepper and enough olive oil to make a thick paste.

Score the top of the roast in 1 or 2 places. Rub the herb paste all over the meat and let stand for 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Oil a roasting pan just large enough to hold the pork. Place the pork in the pan, fat-side up, and roast for 45 minutes, or longer. Pork should be removed when the center is 145. Let rest, tented loosely with foil, for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
