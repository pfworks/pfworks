  2             pounds  flank steak -- pounded to 1/3" thickness
                        ---MARINADE---
  12            ounces  beer
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  3                     green onion -- minced
  3                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seeds -- toasted and ground
                        salt
                        black pepper
                        ---FILLING---
  4             slices  cooked bacon -- crumbled
  1             medium  carrot -- grated
  1              small  baking potato -- parboiled, peeled and grated
     1/4           cup  fresh parsley flat leafed -- chopped
  2                     serrano pepper -- minced
  2                     green onion -- sliced
  2                     garlic clove -- minced
  1           teaspoon  mexican oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
                        beef stock

The night before, place steak in a shallow, nonreactive dish. Combine marinade ingredients and pour the marinade over the meat. Refrigerate overnight.

Drain meat, reserving marinade. Sprinkle salt and pepper lightly over the meat. In a bowl, combine the filling ingredients and spread the mixture evenly over the steak to within about 1/2" of its edges. Roll up steak from one of its longer edges, jellyroll fashion. Transfer the roll to a large piece of cheesecloth, wrap up the roll snug but not tight in the cloth, and tie the ends.

Transfer roll to a Dutch oven or stockpot large enough to hold it. Pour the reserved marinade over it, and the add enough stock to cover it by several inches. Bring to a boil over hight heat, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cover. Cook the roll 2-2.5 hours.

Remove roll from liquid and let meat cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the liquid to pour over meat if you wish. Unwrap the meat, discard the cheesecloth, and slice the meat crosswise. Transfer the slices to platter, pour the liquid over them and garnish with sliced green onions and parsley.

Serve warm. Serve with spicy mustard for extra flavor.
