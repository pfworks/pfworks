  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  apple cider
  1         tablespoon  vinegar based hot sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ginger
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
  6                     cured and smoked pork loin chops (1/2 lb)
                        canola oil

Remove pork from refrigerator and bring to room temperature for 30 minutes.

In a large saute pan, add apple cider, ginger, hot sauce and salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Stir to combine and boil until mixture comes close to a glaze like consistency, 5-8 minutes. Then, add maple syrup, stirring to combine, and letting it boil just quickly, about 1 to 2 minutes until entire sauce reaches glaze-like consistency. Remove from heat.

To cook, prepare grill for med-high heat. Coat grate with oil, as needed. Grill chops for 4-5 minutes on each side, until slightly charred and the chops are warmed through. For the last minute of cooking, brush on the glaze on both sides of chops. Remove from grill and serve with remaining sauce.
