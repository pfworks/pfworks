                        chops
     1/2           cup  hoisin sauce
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  rice vinegar
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced
  1         tablespoon  ginger -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  red pepper flakes
  2                     1/2" thick pork chops
     1/4           cup  honey
                        vegetable oil

Slaw: Whisk together the vinegar, honey and soy sauce. Drizzle the oils in a steady stream, whisking to emulsify. Whisk in the crushed red pepper, cumin, cilantro, scallion, and jalapeno. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the carrot, cabbage, red pepper, pineapple, and nuts and mix well. Add dressing to vegetables and mix well. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.

Place some slaw on a plate. Top woth chips and drizzle with reduced marinade.

Chops: Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl, combine hoison, soy, seasame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes. Add pork chops and turn to coat. Remove chops from marinade.

Reserve marinade and combine with honey in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

Heat an ovenproof skillet over high heat, coat the bottom with a small amount of vegetable oil and sear the chops until golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Pour reduced marinade over the chops and bake for 10 minutes, until 145.

Remove from oven and set aside to rest for a few minutes.
