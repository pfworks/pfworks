--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  penne pasta
  2              large  chicken breast -- boned and skinned
  1              large  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled and seeded
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh garlic -- minced
     1/4           cup  fresh basil -- chopped
  3          teaspoons  chimayo chile powder
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/2           cup  light cream
     1/2           cup  parmesan cheese -- freshly grated

Preheat oven to 350, and oil a medium baking dish. In a large pot, cook the penne in several quarts of boiling salted water until just al dente. Drain the penne, and set aside in oiled dish, covered. Wash and dry the chicken, slice across the grain into julienne strips and set aside. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the olive oil and saute the garlic and all but 1 tbspn of the basil for about 2 minutes. Add the chicken and toss quickly in the hot oil to brown, about 4-5 minutes. Sprinkle the chicken with chile powder, pour in the white wine, and simmer the mixture for 10-15 minutes. Stir in the cream and the roasted pepper strips and continue to simmer slowly until the liquid is reduced and thickened to a creamy sauce. Pour the sauce over the cooked penne in the baking dish and stir gently to mix. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese over the casserole and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Let the dish stand 10 minutes, then sprinkle with remaining basil and serve.
