  1                cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  1                cup  dark brown sugar
     3/4           cup  creamy peanut butter
  1              large  egg

  1           teaspoon  whole milk
     1/2           cup  all-fruit jam

Gather and press dough together, then divide into 2 equal pieces.

Using a sheet of waxed paper, form each piece of dough into a log about 1.5" in diameter. Wrap logs tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

Preheat oven to 400 and lightly butter 2 large baking sheets.

Cut each log crosswise into 1/8" thick slices and arrange slices 1/2" apart on baking sheets.

Top each cookie with a 1/2 tspn dollop of jam.

Bake until edges are slightly browned and centers are set, about 10 minutes.

Cool on sheets 2 minutes, then transfer to a rack and cool completely.
