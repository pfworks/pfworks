                        chile paste
  2                     canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
  2             cloves  garlic
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  2        tablespoons  corn oil
  1           teaspoon  salt
			
  2                     pork tenderloins (1.5 lb each)
  2        tablespoons  dried oregano
			
                        chipotle gravy
  2               cups  chicken stock
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  1           teaspoon  red wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
     1/4           cup  sweet vermouth -- mixed with cornstarch

Combine chiles, sauce, garlic, paste and salt in a food processor and puree to make a paste.

Cut each tenderloin crosswise into 2 pieces. Butterfly each of the pieces by cutting lengthwise down the center, stopping about 1/2" from the other side. Place each piece between 2 pieces of parchment paper or plastic wrap and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to flatten to a thickness 3/4". Rub the meat with the chile paste, reserving 1/4 cup. Sprinkle with oregano. Let the pork stand at room temp for 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling over med-high heat. Grill tenderloins over direct heat, covered, turning once or twice, for about 10 minutes total. Remove from heat at 145 degrees, and let rest, tented with aluminum foil. It's done at 150 degrees.

To make the gravy, in a saucepan over high heat, whisk together the stock, reserved chile paste, w-sauce, sugar and vinegar. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to med-low and whisk in the cornstarch mixture. Cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve.

Serve the tenderloins topped with gravy.
