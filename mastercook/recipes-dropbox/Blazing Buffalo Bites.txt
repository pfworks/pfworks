--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless chicken
                        salt and freshly ground pepper
                        oil
  8             ounces  cream cheese
  1                cup  buffalo wing sauce
  1            package  wonton wrappers
                        water
     1/2           cup  sweetened balsamic vinegar
                        ranch dressing

Dice the chicken into small cubes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat a medium saute pan over medium heat and coat the bottom with a little oil. Add the chicken and saute until cooked through. Put the cream cheese and buffalo sauce in a food processor and process until combined. Add the chicken and pulse to combine but still coarsely chopped.

Lay out an even number of wonton wrappers. Spoon 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture in the center of a wrapper and brush the edges with water. Cover with another wrapper and crimp the edges. Repeat.

Pour enough oil, about 1.5 inches, into a heavy bottomed pot. Once the oil is hot add the wrappers, in batches, and fry until the outside is light and crispy. Remove to paper towels to drain. Eat.
