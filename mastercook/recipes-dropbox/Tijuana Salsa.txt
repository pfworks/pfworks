--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  firm roma tomatoes
  2                     red jalepeno peppers -- seeds and veins removed
     1/3        medium  white onion -- coarsely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic
     1/2           cup  cilantro
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  ground oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  chile powder
  1           teaspoon  red pepper flakes
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt

Coarsely chop all ingredients. Put in blender and puree until well mixed. Texture should be runny, with chunks of tomatoes resembling the consistency of oatmeal. Serve fresh as a dip, or a compliment to just about anything. This salsa will keep refrigerated for about 24 hours.
