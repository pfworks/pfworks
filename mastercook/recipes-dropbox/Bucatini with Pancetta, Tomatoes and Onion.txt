                        coarse salt and pepper
  12            ounces  bucatini or spaghetti
  6             ounces  pancetta -- diced
  1             medium  onion -- chopped
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
  29            ounces  whole tomatoes in juice
     1/2           cup  Percorino Romano

In a large pot of salted water, cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water. Drain and return to pot.

While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-low. Add pancetta, and cook until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Using a slotted spoon, trnasfer pancetta to a paper-towel lined plate to drain, and set aside.

Increase heat to medium. Add onion and garlic to skillet; season with salt and pepper. Cook until onion begins to soften, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add tomatoes (with juice); cook, breaking them up with a spoon, until sauce has slightly thickened, 5 to 8 minutes. Add sauce to pasta in pot; toss, adjusting consistency with pasta water if necessary. Serve pasta topped with pancetta and cheese.
