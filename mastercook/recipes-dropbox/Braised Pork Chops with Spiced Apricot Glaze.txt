  2        tablespoons  butter
  6                     pork loin chops -- trimmed
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/8      teaspoon  ground clove
  3          teaspoons  lemon rind -- minced

  6                     ripe apricots -- peeled, pitted and finely chopped

In a large, heavy stainless steel or enalled skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat, arrange the pork chops in the pan, and brown well on both sides.Add half the orange juice, reduce heat to low, cover, and braise slowly till the chops are tender but till moist inside, about 45 minutes, adding a little more orange juice if necessary.



Meanwhile, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, allspice, cloves, lemon rind, and salt and pepper in a small saucepan and stir until well blended. Add the remaining orange juice and stir over low heat till smooth, about 5 minutes. Add the apricots, return to a simmer, and cook till the apricots are soft and well incorporated into the glaze, about 15 minutes.

Arrange hot chops on plate and spoon glaze over top.
