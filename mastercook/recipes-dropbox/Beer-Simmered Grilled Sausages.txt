--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  uncooked sausages
  1                     onion -- thinly sliced
  3               cups  beer
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        mustard

Prick each sausage a half dozen times with a needle or pin stuck in a cork. Arrange the onion slices on the bottom of a saute pan just large enough to hold all the sausage. Place the sausages on top and add beer and water to cover (3 parts beer/1 part water). Place the pan over medium heat and gradually bring the liquid to a simmer, not a rapid boil. Poach until half-cooked, 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a rack and drain. Separate into links.

Set up grill for med-high direct grilling.

When ready, brush and oil grill grate. Lightly brush sausages on all sides with oil and place on hot grate. Grill until casings are crisp and nicely browned, and sausages are cooked through, about 4-6 minutes per side. 

Transfer to platter and let rest for 3 minutes. Serve with mustard.
