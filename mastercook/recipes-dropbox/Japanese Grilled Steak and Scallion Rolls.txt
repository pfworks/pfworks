     1/2           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  sugar
  3        tablespoons  mirin

Place steak on a large plate and freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.

Bring soy sauce, sugar, mirin and sake to simmer in small saucepan over high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce to medium and cook until slighlty syrupy and reduced to 1/2 cup, 3-5 minutes. Divide evenly between 2 bowls and let cool.

Slice steak 3/8 inch thick on bias against grain until width is 7 inches.Cut in half lengthwise. Cut in half lengthwise. Slice each on bias against grain to make at least 24 slices. Pound to 3/16".

Arrange 3 slices with short sides facing you, overlapping by 1/4" to form a rough rectangle. Place 4 scallion halves on close edge and roll into tight cylinder. Insert 3 toothpicks into center.

Place rolls on grill over charcoal and cook for 4-6 minutes. Flip and brush with glaze. Cook and glaze all 4 sides. Tranfer to board and tent with foil for 5 minutes.

Remove toothpicks and cut crosswise into 3/4 long pieces. Arrange on platter, drizzle with 2 tablespoons reserved glaze, sprinkle with seeds and serve with remaining glaze.
