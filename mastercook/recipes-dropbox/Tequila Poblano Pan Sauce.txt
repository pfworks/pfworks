  1              small  shallot -- minced
  1                     poblano chile -- seeded and diced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2           cup  white tequila
     1/2           cup  low sodium chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  fresh lime juice
  3        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter -- cut into small chunks
  1         tablespoon  fresh cilantro -- chopped

After pan frying steaks, pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pan. Return to high heat and add shallot and poblano; saute, stirring and flipping frequently, until lightly browned and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cumin and cook for 30 seconds. Transfer contents to bowl. Add tequila to pan off heat, reserving 2 tspns, and place pan on high heat. Light on fire and let flames subside. Add chicken broth and 2 tspns lime juice. Reduce to 1/3 cup (about 6 minutes). Add remaining 2 tspns tequila, remaining tspn lime juice, and any meat juices to pan. Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter, cilantro, poblano and shallot; season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon over steaks and serve.
