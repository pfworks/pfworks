Make stuffing: Cook onions with 1.5 tspns salt in 3/4 stick butter in a 12 inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 minutes. Continue to cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until onions are pale golden, about 10 minutes more. Add sage, marjoram, and pepper, and cook, stirring, 5 minutes. Add vinegar and wine and boil, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and remove from heat.

Meanwhile, cook bread crumbs and remaining teaspoon salt in remaining 3/4 stick butter in a 12 inch nonstick skillet over low heat, stirring, until golden and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.

Reserve 1 cup onions mixture, covered and chilled, for sauce. Tranfer remaining mixture to a large bowl and stir in ground pork, celery and crumbs.

Roast pork in lower third of oven, covering stuffing and bone tips after 30m. Add more water if dry. Cook to 155, 2-3 hours.

Bake remaining stuffing 30m before roast is done, covered with foil. Increase oven to 425 after roast is removed and bake without foil until top is crisp.
