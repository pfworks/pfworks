--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1 1/2         pounds  beef round steak -- cut into thin strips
  1 1/4      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground black pepper
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  2                     green pepper -- cut into thin strips
  6             cloves  garlic -- minced
  6        tablespoons  tomato paste
  35            ounces  canned Italian plum tomatoes -- crushed by hand with juice
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  1                cup  ditalini
  2        tablespoons  parsley leaves -- minced

In a Dutch oven or heavy skillet heat the olive oil over high heat. Season the beef with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and black pepper. Saute the beef, in batches if neccessary so that the pan is not crowded, until well-browned on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside. Add the onion and green peppers to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and carmelized around the edges, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomoato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the tomatoes, water, bay leaf, crushed red pepper and remaining 3/4 tspn salt. Return the beef to the pan and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat to med-low and cook, partially covered, for 1.5 hours. Add the ditalini to the gravy and cook until tender, about 25 minutes. Add parsley and serve.
