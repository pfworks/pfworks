--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     double cut bone-in pork chops
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  2        tablespoons  coarsely ground black pepper
                        sauce
  1                     shallot -- minced
     1/2           cup  brandy
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1         tablespoon  green peppercorn -- lightly smashed
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  3        tablespoons  flat leaf parsley -- chopped

Preheat oven to 375. Rub a little oil on both sides of each chop. Mix black pepper and salt together in a small bowl then pour onto a flat plate. Press each side of chops to coat evenly.

Heat a large cast iron pan over high heat. Once lightly smoking, add chops to pan and leave undisturned to sear for 4-5 minutes. Turn the chops over then place in oven to roast for 7-8 minutes.

Remove from oven and set chops aside on a platter to rest. Return pan to stovetop on medium heat and add shallots and green peppercorns and saute until trnaslucent. Move pan away from heat, pur brandy in to deglaze, and set back over heat. Simmer for 30-40 seconds then add heavy cream and reduce for 1 minute until slightly thickened. Add butter and swirl to dissolve evenly. Season to taste and pour over chops.
