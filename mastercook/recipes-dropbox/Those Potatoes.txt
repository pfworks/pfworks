                        Seasoning mix
  3        tablespoons  chile powder
  2          teaspoons  chile powder
  2 1/2      teaspoons  paprika
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
			
  10              cups  potatoes (about 7 med-large) -- peeled and sliced 1/4" thick
  2 1/2           cups  peeled potatoes -- grated
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     3/4           cup  onion -- grated
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  red bell pepper -- diced
     1/4           cup  fresh parsley -- finely chopped
  1                cup  milk
  1                cup  heavy cream
  3               cups  sharp cheddar cheese -- grated
  1                cup  monterey jack cheese -- grated

Combine seasoning mix in small bowl.

Bring a large pot of water to a bowl over high heat. Add the sliced potatoes, return to a boil, and cook until just firm-tender, about 2-3 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.

Preheat oven to 375.

Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a 12 inch skillet over high heat. When it begins to sizzle, add the onions and cook, stirring occassionally until golden, 4-5 minutes.

Stir in 1 tablespoon of seasoning, the grated potatoes and the remaining butter. Cook about 5 minutes, scraping often with a spatula to keep crust from forming on bottom of pan.

Add 1 tablespoon of seasoning mix and 1 cup of stock and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan., until the mixture is thick, light brown and sticking to bottom of pan, 5-6 minutes.

Add peppers, parsley, remaining 1 cup of stock and remaining seasoning. Cook, stirring occassionally for 3 minutes.

Whisk in the milk, breaking up the grated potatoes. Bring to a rolling boil and cook, whisking occassionally, until the sauce is light brown, about 4 minutes.

Add the cream and return to a boil, whisking occassionally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking occassionally, until very thick, 4-5 minutes.

Add 1 cup of cheddar and all of Monterrey Jack and cook, whisking, until the sauce returns to a boil. Remove from heat.

Pour a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a large, deep casserole dish, about 10x10x4. Add the sliced potatoes and pour the remaining sauce over them. Sprinkle the top with remaining 2 cups of cheddar.

Bake, uncovered, until brown and bubbly on top, about 25 minutes.
