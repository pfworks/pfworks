  1                cup  butter -- room temp
     1/2        medium  onion -- finely diced
  10              cups  whole milk
     3/4      teaspoon  iodized salt
     3/4      teaspoon  white pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour

In a small saucepan over low heat, add the onion and 1/2 cup butter and saute until very soft, but do not brown. In another saucepan, scald the milk. Stir the sauteed onions into the milk along with the salt, pepper and nutmeg. Make a blonde roux by mixing the remaining 1/2 cup butter and flour in a small bowl. Add the roux into the milk and cook until it coats the back of a spoon.
