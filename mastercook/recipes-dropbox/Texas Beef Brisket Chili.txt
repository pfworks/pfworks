Drain chiles, reserving liquid. Place chiles in blender. Add 1 cup soaking liquid, garlic, chile powder, cumin seeds, oregano, coriander, and 1.5 tspns coarse salt; blend to puree, adding more liquid by 1/4 cupfuls if very thick. Pour puree over brisket in pot. Add tomatoes with juices, beer, green chiles, and cilantro stems. Stir to coat.

Bring chile to simmer. COver and place in oven. Cook 2 hours. Uncover and cook until beef is almost tender, about 1 hour. Add squash; stir to coat. Roast uncovered until beef and squash are tender, adding more liquid if needed to keep meat covered, about 45 minuyes longer. Season with salt and pepper.
