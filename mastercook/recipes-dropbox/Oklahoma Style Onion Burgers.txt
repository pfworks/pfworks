--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4      teaspoon  canola oil
  5             ounces  ground beef -- 2 balls
                        kosher salt and pepper
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  2             slices  cheese
  2                     hamburger bun

Spread oil on inside of a large cast iron skillet with a paper towel. Heat over high heat until lightly smoking. Add balls of beef and press down with spatula until flattened. Season with salt and pepper.

Spread onions evenly over burgers and press down to embed onions into meat. Let cook with no pressing until well browned, about 2 minutes.

Carefully flip burgers with a stiff spatula, making sure to pick up all browned meat from skillet. Let cook until onions start to soften, about 1 minute. Add cheese and top with bun. Place bottom bun upside down over top bun to steam.


WHen buns are soft, transfer bottom buns to plate. Add condiments and transfer burger and bun to bottom bun.
