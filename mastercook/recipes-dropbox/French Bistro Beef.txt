  3             pounds  center cut beef brisket
  4             slices  thick bacon -- 1/4" slivers
  24                    pearl onion -- peeled
  8             medium  carrots -- peeled, trimmed and cut crosswise into 2" pieces
  2             medium  carrot -- peeled, trimmed and diced
  1              pound  small red potatoes -- cut in half
                        salt and pepper
  1                     onion -- peeled and chopped
  2                rib  celery -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- peeled and chopped
  2                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  cognac
  1                     bottle fruity red wine
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste
  1         tablespoon  chives -- chopped

Preheat oven to 275. Trim excess fat from brisket.

Place bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat and cook until browned, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a platter.

Add pearl onions, carrot pieces, and potoatoes to pot, increase heat to medium-high, and cook until browned, about 3 minutes, stirring often. Using slotted spoon, transfer to platter with bacon. Lightly cover with aluminum foil. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat.

Season brisket with salt and pepper. Place in the pot and sear in bacon fat over med-high heat until darkly browned, about 5 minutes per side. Pour off and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat.

Add chopped carrots, chopped onion, celery, garlic and bay leaves to the pot and cook until browned, about 4 minutes, stirring often.

Add Cognac and boil, stirring up brown bits. Return brisket to pot. Add wine and tomato paste and bring to a boil. Cover and place in oven. Cook until semi-tender, about 3 hours, checking for scorching or sticking.

Remove pot from oven. Uncover the pot, and using a large spoon, remove and discard any surface fat. Stir in bacon and veggies. Cover and return to oven and continue cooking 1 hour longer.

Remove pot from oven. Uncover, spoon off fat, and return to oven. Cook the brisket until very tender and sauce starts to thicken, 30-60 more minutes. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes.

Spoon off fat, remove and discard bay leaves. Transfer brisket to a cutting board and slice crosswise across grain.

Place pot with sauce on stovetop over med-high heat and bring to a boil. Boil until concentrated, about 3 minutes. Season to taste.

Return sliced brisket to sauce. Sprinkle with chives. Serve from pot.
