  4               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  apple juice concentrate
  6                     black pepper corns
  1           teaspoon  chipotle puree
  2        tablespoons  ancho chile puree
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  creme fraiche
                        pork tenderloin
  2                     pork tenderloin, about 12 oz each
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Combine all rub ingredients together and season with salt and pepper.

Combine chicken stock, apple juice, peppercorns, chipotle and ancho puree in a medium saucepan over high heat and reduce to a sauce consistency. Whisk in mustard and creme fraiche and cook for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 400. Dredge tenderloins in the spice rub mixture and patt off any excess. Heat olive oil in medium oven-proof skillet until almost smoking. Add the tenderloin and sear well on all sides. Place the pan in the oven and continue cooking to medium well, about 8 to 10 minutes. Let rest and slice into 1 inch pieces on the diagonal. Spoon sauce onto a platter and top with the slices of pork.
