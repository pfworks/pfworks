                        dough
  1              pound  yukon gold potatoes -- peeled, cut into 2" pieces
  1         tablespoon  coarse kosher salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter
  3              large  eggs
  4 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  warm water
  3                     1/4oz active dry yeast
  2        tablespoons  sugar
                        filling
  1 1/3           cups  golden brown sugar
  2 1/2    tablespoons  ground cinnamon
  3        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  9        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- room temp
                        glaze
  2               cups  powdered sugar
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter -- melted
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/8      teaspoon  coarse kosher salt

For dough: Combine potatoes, 2 cups water, and 1 tbspn salt in a large saucepan. Boil until potatoes are very tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Mash potatoes with water in pan (do not drain). Add butter and mash until butter is melted. Whisk in eggs, then 1 cup flour; mash until very smooth. Let stand until barely lukewarm, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour 1/2 cup water into large bowl of mixer with paddle attacment; stir in yeast and sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add potato mixture to yeast mixture; mix on low speed until well blended, 2 minutes. Mix in 3 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, beating well. Beat until sticky dough forms.

Spread 1/2 cup flour on work surface. Scrape dough out onto floured surface. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic, adding more flour by tablespoonfuls if dough is very sticky, about 8 minutes.

Coat large bowl with butter. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let dough rise in warm, draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Filling: Mix brown sugar, cinnamon and flour in medium bowl. Using fork, mix in butter.

Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 425. Line large rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Turn dough out onto well-floured work surface. Roll out dough to 24x16" rectangle. Sprinkle filling evenly over dough. Starting at 1 long side, roll up dough jelly-roll style, enclosing filling. Using large knife dipped in flour, cut roll crosswise into 12 pieces. Transfer rolls to baking sheet, spacing rolls about 3/4" apart. Cover baking sheet loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in warm, draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, about 20 minutes.

Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Cool rolls 10 minutes on baking sheet.

Make glaze: Whisk powdered sugar, melted butter, 2 tbspns milk, vanilla and coarse salt in small bowl. Spread glaze over warm rolls.
