                        salt
                        salsa roja
  2             pounds  ripe roma tomatoes
  2             medium  white onion -- sliced
  6             cloves  garlic -- peeled
  1 1/2           cups  tomato juice
     1/2           cup  olive oil
                        chipotle chile powder
                        salt and pepper

Heat the corn tortillas in a cast-iron skillet to soften. Put 2 tablespoons mashed potato and a sprinkling of cheese in the center of a tortilla. Roll the tortilla into a cigar shape and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with all tortillas. Cover with towel.

Heat oil in a frying pan to just under smoking point, 365 to 370. Fry the tortillas until crisp and golden, turning to crisp evenly. Drain on paper towels. Keep warm in 200 oven for up to 30 minutes.

To serve, ladle half salsa verde and half salda roja on the flautas. Drizzle creme fraiche over top and sprinkle queso fresco.

Salsa verde: Bring water to boil in a saucepan. Add the tomatillos, half the onions, 5 cloves garlic, 3 chiles, and half the chopped cilantro. Simmer for 30 minutes. Cool and drain, reserving the liquid.

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over high heat. Fry the remaining onions, garlic and chiles until browned.

In a blender, puree the fried mixture with some of the reserved cooking liquid and transfer to a bowl.

Puree the boiled ingredients and add to fried puree. Heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over high heat and pour in the pureed mixture. Add enough reserved cooking liquid to achieve a medium consistency, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently, for about 30 minutes.

Salsa Roja: On a grill, char the roma tomatoes, half the onion, and half the garlic. Cool. Combine grilled veges with remaining onion and garlic. In a blender, in batches, puree the vegetables, adding tomato juice, as needed, to thin.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Pour in the pureed veges and continue to cook, stirring, until the sauce has slightly thickened. Season to taste with chile powder, salt and sugar.
