                        chicken
     1/4           cup  salt
  3 1/2           cups  cider vinegar
  2                     3-4 lb whole chickens, giblets discarded and halved
                        Seasoning
  1         tablespoon  poultry seasoning
                        salt and pepper
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
  3        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  fresh sage -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh rosemary -- minced
     1/2           cup  olive oil

Chicken: Dissolve salt in the vinegar and 2 quarts of cold water in a large container. Submerge the chicken in the brine, cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

Seasoning: Combine the poultry seasoning, 2 tspns salt, and 2 tspns pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Process the vinegar, mustard, sage, rosemary, 1/2 tspn salt, and 1/2 tspn pepper in a blender until smooth, about 1 minute. With the blender running, slowly add the oil until incorporated. Transfer the vinegar sauce to a small bowl and reserve.

charcoal grill: Open bottom vents halfway. Light a large chimney starter 3/4 full. When the coals are hot, pour them evenly over the grill. Set grate in place, cover, and open lid vents halfway. Heat the grill until hot, about 5 minutes.

gas grill: Turn all burners to high, cover and heat the grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all the burners to med-low.

Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove chicken from brine, rinse well and pat dry. Rub the chicken all over with the poultry seasoning mixture.

Arrange the chicken skin side up on the grill and baste with reserved vinegar sauce. Grill, covered, until the chicken is well browned on the bottom and the thickes part of the thigh registers 120, 25 to 30 minutes, basting with the sauce halfway through. Flip chicken skin side down and baste. Continue to grill, covered, until the skin is brown and crisp, the breats registers 160 to 165, and thigh 175, about 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to platter and let rest 5 minutes. Serve.
