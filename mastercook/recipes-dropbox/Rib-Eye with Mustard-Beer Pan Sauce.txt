--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     boneless rib-eye steaks
                        salt and pepper
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1             medium  shallot -- minced
  1                cup  lager or pilsner beer
  1         tablespoon  whole-grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed cast iron skillet over medium heat until just smoking.

Add the steaks and brown well, undisturbed, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and repeat. Remove to a cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, return skillet to stove, add the shallots and cook until just softened, about 1 minute. Stir in the beer and cook until reduced slightly, about 1 minute. Stir in any accumulated meat juices and mustard. Remove the pan from the heat and add the butter. Swirl the pan to melt the butter and whisk to incorporate. Season with salt and pepper, and arrange steaks on serving plates. Pour the sauce over and serve.
