                        cooking spray
  1              pound  Brussels sprout -- trimmed and halved
  1                cup  ricotta cheese
     1/2           cup  Parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
     1/4           cup  Italian bread crumbs
                        zest of 1/2 lemon
  1              pinch  red pepper flakes
  1              clove  garlic -- minced
                        kosher salt
                        black pepper
                        extra virgin olive oil

Preheat oven to 400. Grease a large baking sheet with spray. In a large pot of salted water, blanch sprouts until bright green, 2 minutes. Rinse under cold water, then drain.

Using a small spoon, scoop out insides of sprouts, then transfer hollows to sheet.

Stir together ricotta, Parmesan, bread crumbs, lemon zest and red pepper flakes, and season with salt and pepper. Spoon into sprouts, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with Parmesan.

Bake until ricotta is warmed and sprouts are crispy, 20-25 minutes.
