Season pork with salt and dust lightly with flour.

Heat oil in a Dutch oven or medium size heavy pot over high heat. Add the pork and potatoes to the hot oil and saute until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Add the onion, poblano, and red pepper. Continue cooking until the onion is translucent, 3-5 minutes. Add the orange juice and cola. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced to sauce consistency, 40-50 minutes.
