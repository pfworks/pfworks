--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1              large  yellow onion (2 cups) -- thinly sliced
                        kosher salt
     1/2           cup  tahini
  3        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1              clove  garlic -- finely chopped
  1               head  cauliflower -- 1" florets
     1/4           cup  flat leaf parsley -- finely chopped

Preheat the oven to 450. In a skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and stir to coat with the oil. Stir in 1/2 tspn of salt. Cook, stirring frequently and reducing the heat to prevent burning, until the onions are soft and deep golden brown, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the tahini with 1/2 cup water, 1/2 tspn salt, the lemon juice and the garlic. Set aside.

Grease a large baking sheet with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the cauliflower and turn to coat well with oil. Spread the cauliflower out and season with salt. Roast until browned but not burned on bottom, about 15 minutes. Turn the cauliflower and roast until tender and browned on other side, about 5 minutes longer.

Arrange cauliflower on serving plate. Garnish with onions and parsley, and drizzle with tahini sauce.
