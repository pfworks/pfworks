--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  brown sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
                        salt and pepper
  6             pounds  pork baby back ribs
  3               cups  bbq sauce
                        vegetable oil spray

Mix paprika, sugar, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper together, then rub mixture evenly over ribs. Arrang ribs upright in slow cooker, with meaty sides facing outward. Pour bbq sauce over ribs, cover, and cook until ribs are tender, 6-8 hours on low.

Position oven rack 10 inches from broiler and heat broiler. Place wire rack on foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and coat with spray. Carefully transfer ribs, meaty side down, to prepared baking sheet and tent with foil. Let braising liquid settle for 5 minutes, then remove fat from surface.

Strain liquid into medium saucepan and simmer until thickened and measures 2 cups, 15-20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Brush ribs with some sauce and broil until beginning to brown, 2-4 minutes. Flip ribs over, brush with more sauce, and continue to broil until ribs are well browned and sticky, 9-12 minutes longer, brushing with additional sauce every few minutes.

Transfer ribs to cutting board, tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve with remaining sauce.
