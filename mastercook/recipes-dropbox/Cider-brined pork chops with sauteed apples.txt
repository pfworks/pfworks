  4               cups  apple cider
     3/4           cup  apple cider
  4        tablespoons  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt
  2                     bay leaf
  2             cloves  garlic -- crushed
  1           teaspoon  red chile flakes
  6                     bone-in pork chops -- 3/4" to 1" thick
  3        tablespoons  butter
     3/4           cup  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
     1/2           cup  creme fraiche
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper
                        Sauteed Apples

In a large bowl, mix 4 cups cider, 2 cups cold water, 4 tbsp salt, bay leaves, garlic cloves, and chile flakes. Add pork chops, cover bowl, and chill, turning occasionally, at least 3 hours and up to 1 day.

Preheat oven to 325. Remove pork chops from the brine and blot dry. Melt 2 tbsp butter in a large frying pan over med-high heat. Add pork chops in batches and cook for 3-5 minutes, or until well-browned. Flip chops and brown on other side. Layer chops in a 9x13 baking pan and bake until barely pink in middle, 15-20 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour remaining 3/4 cup cider into the hot frying pan, scraping pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge browned bits. Add the chicken stock, turn the heat to high, and boil until liquid is reduced to 1/2 cup, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 1 tbsp of butter and the mustard. When sauce is no longer bubbling, stir in creme fraiche. Season with remaining 1/2 tsp salt and the pepper. Remove pork from oven and spoon sauce over chops. Top with sauteed apples.
