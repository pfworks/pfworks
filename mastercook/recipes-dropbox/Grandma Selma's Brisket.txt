--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1           teaspoon  sweet paprika
  1           teaspoon  coarsely ground pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  unsweetened cocoa
     1/2      teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground white pepper
  5             pounds  beef brisket -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  4              large  onions -- sliced 1/2" thick
  2             pounds  carrots -- cut diagonally 1/8" thick
  2               cups  Coca Cola
  28            ounces  crushed tomatoes
     1/4           cup  ketchup

In a bowl, mix the brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cocoa, coriander and white pepper. Rub the mixture all over the brisket, set it in a baking dish and cover it with foil. Refrigerate overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350. In a large enamelled cast-iron casserole, heat the oil. Add the brisket, fat side down, and brown well over moderately high heat, 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.

Reduce the heat to moderate and add the onions. Stir well, cover and cook, stirring, until softened, about 15 minutes. Add the carrots, cover and cook, stirring, until the carrots begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

Add the coca-cola, tomatoes and ketchup to the pot and stir over moderate heat. Add the brisket and any juices and spread the onions and carrots around the meat. If neccessary, add enough water to half-submerge the brisket in liquid. Cover tightly and braise in the oven for 2.5 hours. 

Transfer the  brisket to a cutting board, cover with foil and let stand for 30 minutes. Raise the oven temperature to 425. Slice the meat across the grain, 1/4" thick, return to the casserole and spoon the sauce over the meat.

Return the pot to the oven and cook uncovered for 1 hour, or until fork tender. Check every 20 minutes; if necessary, add water so the meat is half submerged. Remove from the oven and let stand for 15 minutes. Transfer the meat to a platter, spoon the onions, carrots and sauce over and serve.
