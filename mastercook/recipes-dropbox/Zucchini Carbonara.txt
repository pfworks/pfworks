                        sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
  6             medium  green and yellow zucchini
  1              pound  penne
  4              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  2                     handfulls freshly grated parmesan
                        olive oil
  12            slices  thick bacon or pancetta
  1              bunch  fresh thyme

Place a large pan of salted water to boil. Halve and quarter any larger zucchini lengthwise. Cut out fluffly middle bits, then slice at an angle into small pieces, about the size and shape of penne. Add penne to boiling water and cook to al dente.

Put egg yolks in bowl, add cream and half of parmesan and mix. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

Heat a very large frying pan, add a splash of olive oil and fry the pancetta or bacon until dark brown and crisp. Add the zucchini slices and 2 big pinches of black pepper. Sprinkle in thyme leaves and stir until coated. Fry until zucchini is lightly golden.

Drain pasta and reserve a little water. Toss pasta in pan with zucchini, then remove from heat and add a ladleful of cooking water and the creamy sauce. Stir quickly.

Sprinkle in the rest of the parmesan and serve.
