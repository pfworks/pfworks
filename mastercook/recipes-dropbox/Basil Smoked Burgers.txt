     1/4           cup  fresh italian bread crumbs
  8                     sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  garlic salt
                        vegetable oil
  8              large  basil sprigs -- moistened
  6                     seeded sandwich rolls
  6             slices  monterey jack cheese
  6                     red lettuce leaves
  6                     tomato slice -- 1/4" thick
  6                     red onion slices -- paper thin
  6                     basil sprigs
                        pesto mayonnaise
     2/3           cup  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  prepared fresh basil pesto

Prepare grill to med-high.

Combine pesto and mayonnaise and refrigerate.

To make the patties, combine the sirloin, Zinfandel, basil, onion, bread crumbs, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic salt in a large bowl. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compaction, mix well. Divide into 6 equal portions and make patties.

Brush rack with oil. Toss the moistened sprigs directly on the fire. Place the patties on the rack, cover, and cook, turning once, until done to preference, 5-7 minutes per side. During the last few minutes, place the rolls cut side down, on the outer edges of rack to toast lightly. During last minute, top each patty with a slice of cheese.

Spread mayo on cut side of rolls. On the bottom, place a lettuce leaf, a patty, a tomato slice, an onion slice, and a basil sprig. Add the tops and serve.
