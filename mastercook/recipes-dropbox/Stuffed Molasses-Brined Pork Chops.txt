                        Molasses Brine
  3 1/2           cups  water
     1/4           cup  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  molasses
  1                cup  ice cubes
     1/4      teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  4                     bone-in-rib pork chops (1.5" thick) about 3 lbs total
     1/2         pound  sage sausage
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
                        freshly ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  olive oil

Pour the water into a large bowl or plastic storage tub. Add the salt, brown sugar, molasses and vanilla. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolve. Stir in the ice cubes to chill the mixture to 45F or less. Add the pork chops, cover and refrigerate for 4-6 hours.

Preheat oven to 400

Remove the pork chops fromi brine and pat dry with paper towels.

Combine the sausage and bread crumbs.

Cut a pocket in each chop parallel to the cut surface and fill with the sausage mixture. Sprinkle both sides of chop with pepper.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over med-high heat. Add 2 chops and sear on both sides until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove and sear remaining chops in the same manner. Place the chops in a baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Turn the chops and cook for another 10 to 15 minutes or until the internel temperature of the sausage filling reaches 150F. Remove pan from oven, put chops on a platter and let rest for 10 minutes.
