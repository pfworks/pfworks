  3              large  eggs -- lightly beaten
  1         tablespoon  sour cream
  1 1/2           cups  corn kernels
                        canola oil
                        red chile glaze

Combine flour, baking powder, salt and chile powder in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and sour cream; whisk together until smooth. Add corn.

Heat oil 3/4" deep in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat to 350. Carefully drop heaping tablespoon dollops into the hot oil. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown on the outside and cooked through. Remove from oil and put on paper towel -lined plate to cool.
