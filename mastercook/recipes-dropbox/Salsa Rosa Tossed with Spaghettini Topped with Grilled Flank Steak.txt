                        Salsa Rosa
  12             whole  red bell pepper
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  grey salt
  4              whole  serrano pepper
  6             cloves  garlic
     1/2           cup  tomato puree
  2             sprigs  fresh oregano
     3/4           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                     flank steak
  1              pound  spaghettini

Preheat oven to 450. Coat peppers with olive oil and place on a foil lined baking sheet. Salt liberally. Bake in the oven, turning every 10 minutes until peppers are blistered and black, 20 to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a hot saute pan. Add the serrano chiles and the garlic. Lower the heat to moderate and cook,  turning occasionally, until the chiles are softened, lightly browned, and blistered on all sides. Remove pan from heat the let the chiles cool in the oil for several minutes.

When the roasted bell peppers are blistered and blackened, remove them from the oven, place in a glass bowl and cover with plastic wrap. After 15-20 minutes, remove the peppers and peel. Seed and stem, and don't rinse.

Chop the garlic finely, then use the side of the knife to mash into a paste with a pinch of grey salt. Add to blender.

Peel chiles and remove the stems and seeds. Add to blender. Add puree, oregano and olive oil used to roast chiles to belnder. Turn blender on high and puree until smooth.

Turn a medium saute pan on high for 30 seconds with 1/4 cup of olive oil. Pour blender mixture in pan. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in 1/4 cup olive oil and red wine vinegar.

Season steak with salt and pepper and drizzle with oil. Grill to medium-rare, about 4 minutes per side. Let rest 10 minutes.

Cook salsa to al dente and toss with sauce.

Top with thinly sliced flank steak.
