--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  spicy brown mustard
  1         tablespoon  chili sauce
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar -- packed
  4                     red potato -- quartered
  1                     white onion -- chopped
  4             pounds  round roast

Mix the flour, mustard, chili sauce, worcestershire, vinegar and brown sugar in a small bowl. Set aside. Place potatoes and onion on the bottom of the slow cooker. Add the round roast, and then top with most of the mustard mixture, reserving about 3 tablespoons. Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, or until meat and vegetables are cooked through. When ready to serve, remove roast, slice and place on individual plates. Drizzle with reserved mustard mixture. Serve remaining vegetables with a slotted spoon.
