  4        tablespoons  black peppercorns -- lightly cracked
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  red onion -- minced
  1         tablespoon  garlic -- minced

Preheat grill to high heat.

Cut steak into 8 oz pieces and lightly tenderize with mallet. Dust with crushed black pepper and kosher salt. Press salt and pepper into steak with palm of hand. Transfer steaks to a baking dish and refrigerate for 4-8 hours.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add olive oil and onions and lightly saute until carmelized. Add garlic and cook until garlic turns brown. Deglaze with wine and balsamic vinegar. Add sugar and let simmer and reduce for 20 to 30 minutes until reduced to 3/4 cup.

Place steaks over a hot grill. Move once on first side to mark the steaks, cook for 5 minutes and flip, again only moving once to mark steak, cook for 4 minutes. When desired doneness is achieved, remove steaks from grill and let rest for 3 to 4 minutes.
