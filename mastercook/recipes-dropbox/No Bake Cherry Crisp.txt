                        topping
     3/4           cup  sliced almonds
     2/3           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar -- packed
     1/4           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
                        filling
     1/3           cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  2             pounds  frozen sweet cherries
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  almond extract
     2/3           cup  dried cherries

Topping: Finely chop 1/4 cup almonds. Combine flour, brown sugar, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and chopped almonds in a bowl. Stir in melted butter until it resembles wet sand and no dry flour remains.

Toast remaining 1/2 cup almonds in a nonstock skillet over med-low heat until just beginning to brown, about 4 minutes. Add flour mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, 6-8 minutes; transfer to plate to cool. Wipe out skillet.

Filling: Combine 2 tablespoons sugar and cornstarch in small bowl; set aside. Combine cherries, lemon juice, vanilla, salt, almond extract, and remaining sugar in skillet. Cover and cook over medium heat until cherries thaw and release juice, about 7 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking. Uncover, stir in dried cherries, and simmer until cherries are tender, about 3 minutes.

Stir in cornstarch mixture and simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened, 1-3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and distribute topping evenly over filling. Return skillet to med-low heat and cook until filling is bubbling around edges, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool at least 30 minutes before serving.
