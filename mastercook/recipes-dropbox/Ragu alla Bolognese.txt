--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              small  yellow onion -- finely chopped
  2              large  carrot -- 1/4" dice
  4             stalks  celery -- 1/4" dice
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  3             pounds  lean ground beef
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3               cups  dry white wine
  2               cups  low-fat milk
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  2                     28oz can whole peeled tomatoes
  1                     14oz can whole peeled tomatoes

Put onions, carrots, celery, butter and oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven and place over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, 8 to 15 minutes.

Add beef and break up with wooden spoon. Season with salt and continue stirring unti lthe meat has lost its red color, about 4 minutes.

Add wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until it has almost completely evaporated, 18 to 25 mintues. Add milk and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally, until the milk has mostly evaporated, 12 to 18 minutes.

Coarsely chop the tomatoes and add them and juice to pot. Once the tomatoes have started bubbling, reduce the heat to low so that sauce is barely simmering. Cook uncovered for 4 hours, stirring occasionally. If all the liquid evaporates, add water 1/2 cup at a time as needed. After 4 hours, make sure all liquid has evaporated before removing from heat. Skim any fat from surface before serving.
