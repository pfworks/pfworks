                        Glaze
  2               cups  pure maple syrup
     1/2           cup  prepared horseradish -- drained
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  ancho chile powder

     1/2           cup  spanish paprika
  3        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  3        tablespoons  new mexican chile powder
  2        tablespoons  ground coriander
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  kosher salt
  2          teaspoons  ground black pepper
  3               cups  wood chips (hickory, mesquite or applewood)
  4                     racks pork ribs (3 lbs each)

Glaze: Whisk together, season with salt and pepper.

Ribs: Stir spices together in med bowl. About 1/2 hour before cooking time, soak chips in enough water to cover. Drain chips. In a covered grill, place slow burning charcoal in both sides of a drip pan. Sprinkle coals with wood chips.

Rub top side of each rack with about 3 tablespoons of the rub. Place ribs, bone side down, on grill. Close cover or place cover on smoker. Grill about 1.5 hours, adding chips every 20 minutes. During the last 10 minutes, brush liberally with the maple-horseradish glaze.
