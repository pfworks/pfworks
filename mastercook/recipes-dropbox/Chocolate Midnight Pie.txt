--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        crust
    1/16           cup  all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  confectioner's sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt (heaping)
  6        tablespoons  cold unsalted butter
     1/4      teaspoon  cocoa powder
  5        tablespoons  heavy cream
                        filling
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  4              large  egg
     1/4           cup  dutch-process cocoa powder
  2        tablespoons  amaretto
  1         tablespoon  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  yellow or white cornmeal
     2/3           cup  semiswee or bittersweet chocolate chips

Crust: Stir together the flour, sugar and salt.

Work the butter into the dry mixture until the dough is evenly crumbly.

Dissolve the cocoa powder in 1 tablespoon of the cream. Sprinkle up to 5 tablespoons of the cream into the dry ingredients, continuing to mix until the dough is cohesive. Grab a handful; if it holds together willingly, and doesn't seem dry or crumbly, you've added enough liquid.

Shape the dough into a disk. Roll its edges along a floured work surface (as though it were a wheel), in order to smooth them out. Pat the disk until it's about 1" thick, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.

Preheat the oven to 350. Remove dough from the refirgerator. Allow it to warm a bit and become flexible, 15 to 30 minutes.

Flour your work surface, and roll the dough into a 12" circle. Transfer the dough to a regular 9" pie pan that's at least 1 1/4" deep. Trim and crimp the edges. Place the crust in the refrigerator to chill, while you're preparing the filling.

Beat together the butter, sugar, and salt until smooth.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating slowly but thouroughly after each addition; you want to combine them with the butter and sugar, but not beat in a lot of air.

Stir in the cocoa, liquer, cream and vanilla.

Use a food processor to grind together the cornmeal and chocolate chips. Add to the batter. Pour the batter into the crust.

Bake the pie for 45 minutes, adding a crust shield after 20 minutes. The middle may look pretty soft; so long as the temperature has reached 165 right in the center, the pie is done.

Remove the pie from the oven, cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight.
