     1/4           cup  olive oil
  3             cloves  garlic -- peeled and halved
                        dressing
  3        tablespoons  olive oil

Using spatula, turn potatoes over and cook, drizzling with oil, until golden brown, another 5-8 minutes.

In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, parsley, thyme, and lemon zest. Season with salt and pepper.
