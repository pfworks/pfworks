--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  chocolate hazelnut spread
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  brown sugar
  1                     egg
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     3/4           cup  chopped hazelnut -- toasted

Preheat oven to 375.

In a medium bow combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

In another medium bowl, combine the butter, chocolate hazelnut spread, sugar and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer, cream the ingredients together, about 4 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture until just combined. Add the hazelnuts and stir until just combined.

Using a tablespoon, measure, spoon out the cookie dough onto a cookie sheet, spacing the mounds about 4 inches apart. Use the tines of a fork to flatten the cookie dough. Bake until lightly golden around the edges, about 10 to 12 minutes. Use a metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let cool.
