In a medium bowl, gently knead the pork with the crisp bacon and liquid smoke. Looslely form the meat into 4 patties about 3/4" thick and set the on a plate lined with plastic wrap. Sprinkle the spice mixture all over the burgers, patting to help it adhere. Brush the burgers and both sides of the bread with remaining butter.
