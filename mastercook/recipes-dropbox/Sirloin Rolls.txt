--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  fish sauce
  2        tablespoons  sesame oil
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  shallot -- minced
  1         tablespoon  scallion -- minced, white and green parts
  1         tablespoon  peeled lemon -- minced
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1 1/2         pounds  partially frozen sirloin strip steaks, fat trimmed, 2.5 to 3 inches thick
  6                     lemongrass stalks, peeled and trimmed to 1/4" diameter and cut into twelve 6" pieces
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  sunflower or canola oil

In a small bowl, mix together the fish sauce, oil, sherry, shallot, scallion, lemongrass and soy sauce until well blended. You will have about 3/4 cup of chunky sauce. Pour half each into separate bowls.

Holding a knife at a sharp angle, slice the sirloin into 12 very thin slices, each 2.5 to 3 inches wide. Lay the meat on a work surface and brush 1 side of each slice with sauce. Lay a lemongrass stalk lengthwise along each strip and roll up. Arrange rolls, seam-side down, in a shallow glass dish and brush the tops and sides with more sauce. Cover and refrigerate for about an hour.

Whisk the sugar and cornstarch into the reserved sauce.

In a saute pan, heat oil over med-high heat and when hot, cook the rolls, seam side down, for about 1 minute or until browned. Turn gently and continue to cool for another minute or so to brown on all sides.

Drizzle reserved sauce over rolls and cook for 3-4 minutes or until heated through. Serve immediately.
