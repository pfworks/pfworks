--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  heavy cream
  3        tablespoons  garlic -- minced
  2        tablespoons  shallot -- minced
  6                     black peppercorn
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2           cups  grated aged gouda
     1/2           cup  grated parmesan cheese
                        kosher salt
  1 1/4         pounds  broccoli (about 2 large heads) cut into small florets, stems cut crosswise into 1/4" slices
  3        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  1           teaspoon  crushed red chile flakes
  2               cups  original cheetos -- crushed by hand

Make the cheese sauce: Heat cream, 2 tbsp garlic, shallots, peppercorns and bay leaf in a 2 qt saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring often, until reduced by half, about 6 minutes. Remove pan from heat, stir in cheeses until melted, and season with salt. Set a fine strainer over a small saucepan and strain sauce, discarding solids. Set aside and keep warm.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add broccoli and cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain broccoli, transfer to a bowl of ice water, and let chill. Drain and transfer to paper towels to dry; set aside. Heat oil in a 12" skillet over medium high heat. Add remaining garlic and chile flakes and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add broccoli and cook, stirring often, until just subtly browned, about 6 minutes.

To serve, spoon cheese sauce evenly among 6 warm serving bowls or small plates. Top sauce with broccoli and a generoud sprinkling of Cheetos. Serve immediately.
