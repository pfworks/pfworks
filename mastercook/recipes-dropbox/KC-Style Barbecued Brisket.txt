  10            pounds  whole beef brisket -- untrimmed
                        KC Sweet and Hot Rub

Generously coat all sides of brisket, especially the fat layer, with the rub. Cover and let meat come to room temperature, about 1 hour.

Prepare a grill/smoker for indirect heating.

When the fire has burned down to embers, or the coals are covered in gray ash, place the brisket on the grate but not over the coals. Or place a full pan of water over the lava locks, then add grate and brisket. The fire should be 225 to 250.

Cover the cooker and smoke the brisket, turning every hour until tender and temp reads 180-190. (about 8-10 hours)

Brush the brisket with mop when turning. Keep temp of cooker between 225 and 300.

When the brisket is charred and tender, remove it and let sit 20 minutes.

Trim off the fat layer and cut into slices across the grain.
