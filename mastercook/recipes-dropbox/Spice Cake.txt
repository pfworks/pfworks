  4          teaspoons  sour cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

  1 3/4           cups  powdered sugar
     3/4           cup  walnuts -- toasted and chopped (optional)

For the cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350. Grease and flour 13x9 pan. Combine cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, cloves, and nutmeg in a small bowl; set aside 1/2 tspn spice mixture.

Melt 4 tablespoons butter in 8 inch skillet over medium heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Cook, swirling pan constantly, until butter is light brown and has faint nutty aroma, 2 to 4 minutes. Add spice mixture and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for 15 seconds. Remove from heat and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.

Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Gently whisk eggs and yolks and vanilla in small bowl until combined. Using stand mixer with paddle, beat remaining 12 tablespoons butter with sugar and molasses on med-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Reduce speed to medium; add ginger, cooled butter mixture, and half of egg mixture; and mix until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg mixture and scrape down bowl. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk in 2 additions, scraping down bwl as needed. Continue to mix at medium speed until batter is combined, about 15 seconds. Give a final hand stir.

Transfer batter to pan and smooth top. Run tip of metal spatula to edges in a zigzag pattern to edges and tap pan on counter. Bake for 32-37 minutes. Cool completely in pan on wire rack for 2 hours.

Frosting: Using stand mixer with whisk, mix cream cheese, butter, sour cream, vanilla, and salt at med-high speed until well combined, about 30 seconds, scraping down bowl. Add sugar and mix until fluffy, about 1 minute.

Stir reserved spices into frosting. Spread evenly over top of cake. If using walnuts, sprinkle and serve.
