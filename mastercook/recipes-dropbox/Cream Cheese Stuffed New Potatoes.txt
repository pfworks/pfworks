  24                    bite sized new potatoes, tiny sliver cut off end so it will stand -- scrubbed
  5             ounces  soft garlic herb cheese
  4        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/3           cup  whipping cream
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        fresh parsley -- chopped

In a large pot with plenty of salted water, boil the potatoes until they are fork-tender, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and let potatoes cool until you can handle them.

With a melon baller, remove a scoop from each potato. Combine the cheese, butter and cream. Add salt and pepper as needed. Spoon or pipe mixture into potatoes.

Garnish with parsley.

Stand potatoes on end to serve.
