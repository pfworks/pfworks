--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5               cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  kosher salt
  3        tablespoons  freshly ground black pepper
  5                     egg whites
  1 1/2           cups  water
     1/2           cup  chopped fresh herbs (parsley, thyme and/or sage)
  7             pounds  beef tenderloin -- trimmed
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

Place the flour, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites and water and add to the dry ingredients along with the 2 tablespoons of the herbs. Combine with a potato masher until the mixture begins to come together. Then knead with your hands for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large zip-lock bag, seal, and let stand at room temperature for 4 hours, or up to 24 hours.

Transfer dough to a floured surface and roll out to 3/16 inch thickness, approximately a 24 by 18 inch rectangle. Trim away extra dough. Sprinkle remaining herbs on the center section of the dough and gently press down.

Preheat oven to 400.

In order to achieve uniform cooking, fold over slender tail end of tenderloiin and tie with kitchen twine. Set a large electric griddle at its highest setting; brush the tenderloin with the olive oil and sear on all sides until well browned, 10 minutes. Rest the meat for at least 5 minutes or until it is cool to the touch so as not to melt the dough.

Place tenderloin in center of dough. Fold top part of dough over, flipping back about 1 inch of dough onto itself. Repeat with bottom half of dough. Press together the two flaps of dough and seal. Make sure dough is not too tight around tenderloin. At the ends, press together to seal and cut away any excess. Transfer to a sheet pan, place in the oven and roast to an internal temperature of 125F, about 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest for 30-60 minutes. Cut crust at one end and pull out tenderloin. Slice and serve.
