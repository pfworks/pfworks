--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        sponge
     1/2           cup  warm water
  1            package  active dry yeast
     3/4           cup  unbleached flour
                        dough
     3/4           cup  warm water
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
                        pinch of salt
  3 1/2           cups  unbleached flour
                        topping
  3               cups  6-1 brand tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  oregano
                        salt to taste
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  10            ounces  mozzarella cheese -- grated

Dough: First, make the sponge. Put the 1/2 cup of warm water into a 4 to 5 quart mixing bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on the water and stir in to dissolve. Add the flour and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cover the bowl with plastc wrap and a kitchen towel. Set aside in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.

After the initial sponge rise, add most of the 3/4 cup water, vegetable oil, salt, and the rest of the flour to the sponge. Stir and mix thouroughly. If the dough seems at all stiff, add more warm water.

Turn the dough out of the bowl onto a floured work surface. Knead the dough for about 8 minutes until it is smooth and soft. If the dough feels sticky, dust with flour. Place the dough in a lightly floured, 4-5 qt mixing bowl; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel. Set the bowl in a warm place and let rise for 1.5 hours, until doubled in bulk.

After the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down and turn it out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead the dough for about 2 minutes. Lightly oil the bottom and sides of the pan. Try to make the dough an even thickness. Set the pan in a warm place, covered with a kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in the pan for about 40 minutes.

TOPPING: In a bowl, combine the tomato puree and the oregano. Taste for salt.

ASSEMBLE and BAKE: Preheat oven to 425. After the dough has risen in the pan, spread tomato puree evenly over the surface of the dough. Leave a 1/2" border. Drizzle the oil over the tomatotoes. Sprinkle on the grated cheese. Bake for 30-35 minutes.
