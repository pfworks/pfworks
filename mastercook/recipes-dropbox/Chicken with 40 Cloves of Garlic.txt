  6                     12-oz bone-in, skin-on, split chicken breasts -- trimmed
                        salt and pepper
  2        tablespoons  extra virgin olive oil
  40            cloves  garlic -- peeled
  4                     shallot -- peeled and quartered pole to pole
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
     3/4           cup  dry vermouth or dry white wine
     3/4           cup  chicken broth
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  fresh rosemary -- minced
  2                     bay leaf
  2        tablespoons  fresh parsley -- minced

Dry chicken with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12 inch skillet over med-high heat until just smoking. Add half of the chicken, skin side down, and brown lightly, about 5 minutes; transfer to plate. Repeat with remaining oil and chicken; transfer to plate. Let cool slightly and discard skin.

Add garlic and shallots to fat left in pan and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until garlic is fragrant and lightly browned, 8-10 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in vermouth, scraping up any browned bits and smothing out any lumps; transfer to slow cooker.

Stir broth, thyme, rosemary and bay leaves into slow cooker. Nestle browned chicken with any accumulated juice into slow cooker. Cover and cook until chicken is tender, 4-6 hours on low.

Transfer chicken, garlic and shallots to serving platter and tent loosely with foil. Let braising liquid settle for 5 mintues, then remove fat from surface. Discard bay leaves. Stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1 cup sauce over chicken and serve with remaining sauce.
