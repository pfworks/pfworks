--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             ounces  dried ancho chile
  3             ounces  dried guajillo chile
  5                     dried chile de arbol -- stemmed, seeded and crumbled
  4               cups  boiling water

In a large heavy skillet over med heat, and working in batches , toast the ancho and guajillo chiles, turning once or twice, until the chiles are limber and fragrant, 1-2 minutes per side. Let cool, then stem, seed and cut into small pieces with kitchen scissors.

Transfer to a medium large heatproof bowl. Add the chiles de arbol and boiling water. Cover and let stand, stirring occassionally until the water is cool and the chiles are reconstituted , at least 1 hour or longer.

Drain the chiles, reserving 3/4 cup of the water. Transfer the chiles to a food processor and blend, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides of the bowl until the chiles are pureed. Add the reserved liquid to loosen the blades.

Transfer to a coarse sieve over a bowl. With a flexible rubber scraper, force the puree through the sieve into the bowl. Also scrape from bottom of sieve into bowl. Discard the tough bits of peel.
