--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  pecans
     1/2         pound  sliced bacon
  8             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped
  2             ounces  unsweetened chocolate -- chopped
  10       tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1                cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  light brown sugar -- packed
  3        tablespoons  bourbon
  4              large  egg
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour

Preheat oven to 350. Line a 9 inch square baking pan with parchment paper, allowing 2 inches of overhang on 2 opposite sides. Spray with vegetable spray. Spread the pecans in a pie plate and toast for 8 minutes, until fragrant. Let cool, then coarsely chop.

In a skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat, turning once, until crisp, 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels and let cool; reserve 3 tablespoons fat. Finely chop bacon.

In a saucepan, combine both chocolates with butter and stir over very low heat until melted; scrape into large bowl. Using a handheld electric mixer, beat in both sugars with reserved fat. Beat in the bourbon. Add eggs and salt and beat until smooth. Sift cocoa and flour into the bowl and beat until blended.

Scrape the batter into prepared pan and sprinkle the bacon and pecans on top. Bake for about 50 minutes, until brownies are set around the edges, but slightly wobbly in the middle. A toothpick should have some batter on it. Transfer to rack and cool completely. Lift out with parchment paper and cut into squares.
