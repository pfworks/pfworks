--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  water -- 110 degrees
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  1         tablespoon  instant or rapid rise yeast
  3               cups  all-purpose flour
     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2             quarts  vegetable oil
                        powdered sugar

Combine water, 1 tablespoon sugar, and yeast in large bowl and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Combine flour, remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, and salt in a second bowl. Whisk eggs and 2 tablespoons oil into yeast mixture. Add flour mixture and stir vigorously with rubber spatula until dough comes together. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet. Line second sheet with parchment paper and dust heavily with flower. Place half of dough on well-floured counter and pat into rough rectangle with floured hands, flipping to coat with flour. Roll dough into 1/4" thick rectangle (12x9). Using pizza wheel, cut dough into 12 3-inch squares and transfer to floured sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
