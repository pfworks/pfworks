  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2         pounds  tenderloin, top sirloin or other tender boneless beef -- 1" cubes
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  3                     serrano pepper -- minced

In a dutch oven or large saucepan, warm the oil over high heat. Brown the meat in the oil, turning frequently for 4-5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove the meat and reserve it.
