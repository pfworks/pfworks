                        cake
  2 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  2 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  3              large  eggs -- room temp
  1                cup  Caramel
  1                cup  water -- combined with caramel
                        frosting
  2               cups  light brown sugar -- firmly packed
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
  2 1/2           cups  confectioner's sugar -- sifted

Preheat oven to 350.

Grease and lightly flour two 9x2 inch round cake pans. Line the bottom with waxed paper.

To make the cake: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl, on the medium speed of an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the dry ingredients in thirds, alternating with the caramel mixture, beating after each addition until smooth.

Divide the batter between the prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean. Let cake cool in pans for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on a wire rack.

To make the frosting: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, place the brown sugar, cream and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and let cool for about 20-30 minutes. Add the confectioner's sugar and beat with an electric mixer until the frosting is perfectly smooth. If too thick, beat in a bit more heavy cream.

When cake has cooled, ice between the layers, then ice top and sides of cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  cold water
  3               cups  sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream

Combine water and sugar in medium saucepan. Set over med-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves (about 3 minutes), making sure no sugar is sticking to the sides of the pan. Increase heat to high and boil without stirring, until the syrup becomes a deep amber color, about 15 minutes. To prevent the syrup from becoming grainy, use a pastry brush dipped into cold water to brush down any sugar crystals sticking to the sides of the pan. Swirl the pan occasionally for even browning.

Once the syrup turns deep amber in color, immediately remove from heat. Slowly and carefully add the cream to the syrup, whisking constantly, until cream is incorporated.

Return the pan to med-low heat, stirring until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute.

Remove from heat and allow to come to room temperature before refrigerating. Can be stored up to 1 month.
