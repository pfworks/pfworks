     1/2           cup  butter -- softened
  1                cup  sugar
  2                     eggs

Preheat oven to 375. Line muffin pans with 18 cupcake papers, set aside. Sift flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon in large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and beat until smooth. Spoon into the cupcake papers so they are half full. Bake 12-14 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Put softened butter into bowl. Sift the powdered sugar and cocoa over the butter. Cream together on low speed. Gradually add the vanilla and milk and mix on medium until frosting is smooth.
