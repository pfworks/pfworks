--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1            package  instant yeast
  2          teaspoons  fresh lemon zest
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/4      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  ground clove
     3/4           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  warm milk
     1/4           cup  warm maple syrup
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- melted
  1                     egg

In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer thouroughly combine all of the whole wheat flour and 1 3/4 cups of the all-purpose flour with yeast, zest, salt, coriander, nutmeg and cloves.

In a smaller bowl, combine water, milk, syrup and melted butter.

Stir flour mixture on low and add liquid mixture until shaggy. Switch to the dough hook, and, still on low, knead until dough is cohesive. Increase speed to medium low and knead for 8 minutes. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl. If not, add more flour.

Form dough into ball by using fingers to stretch edges underneath, forming ball in palms. Place dough in bowl spritzed with oil and spritz top of ball with oil. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch down dough and scoop out into unfloured bowl. Fold over twice, pressing firmly with hands. Cover and let rest 10 minutes. Stretch and roll into 12" log.

Cut log in half, then cut each half in half, then each quarter in half. Cover with plastic.

Take one quarter, cut in half, and form each piece into a small ball by squeezing edges into center. Place a ball seam side down on an unfloured surface. Cup one hand over and roll in circular motion to form a ball. Place on a baking sheet and repeat.

Spritz top with oil, cover with plastic, and let rise till doubled in size.

Heat oven to 400. Whisk egg and 1 tbspn water.

Brush tops of rolls with wash then place in center of oven, immediately reducing heat to 375. Bake until well browned, 20 to 25 minutes, turning pan halfway through.
