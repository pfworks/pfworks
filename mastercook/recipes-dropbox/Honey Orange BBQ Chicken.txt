--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Marinade
     1/2           cup  freshly squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  olive oil
     1/4           cup  hot sauce
     1/4           cup  dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  orange zest -- grated
  4             pounds  chicken cut into 10 pieces
                        Glaze
  4        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  honey
     1/4           cup  freshly squeezed orange juice
     1/4           cup  BBQ sauce
  1         tablespoon  orange zest -- grated
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard
     1/4      teaspoon  allspice

Mix orange juice, olive oil, hot sauce, mustard, and orange zest together in a large bowl. Add the chicken and toss to combine. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for at least 1 hour and up to overnight in the refrigerator.

Prepare grill.

Drain chicken from marinade and pat dry. Grill on each side for 5 minutes, then turn heat down and cover grill. Continue cooking the chicken until it's cooked through, about 25 minutes more.

While chicken is grilling, melt butter in a small saucepan on the grill. Whisk in honey, orange juice, BBQ sauce, zest, mustard, and allspice. Reserve some glaze for serving.

Brush chicken with glaze, the flip chicken, glaze side down, and cook for 2 minutes. Brush again and flip. Cook for 3 more minutes. Remove from grill and serve with reserved glaze.
