To make the marinade, heat the de arbol powder, ancho powder, cayenne and cumin for 45-60 seconds in a small saute pan over medium low heat. Transfer the spice mixture to a small bowl, and whisk in the orange juice, water, garlic puree, molasses, and oregano. Gradually whisk the oil in a stedy stream.

Season meat with 1 tspn of angel dust and the jerk. Place pork in resealable bag, add marinade and refrigerate for 8-24 hours.

When ready to cook, heat a grill. Remove pork from bag and discard marinade. Slice into 12 equal portions. Pound each pork to 1/8 thick. Combine remaining angel dust with salt, pepper and de arbol. Lightly brush both sides of pork with oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Thread each piece of meat on a skewer. Grill for 6-7 minutes.

Puree: Place the garlic in a small, ovenproof container and pour in the oil. Completely immerse garlic. Cover with foil and roast 1 hour at 350 until soft and golden brown. Strain the garlic and place in blender with 2 tablespoons of oil. Puree until smooth. Store with a small layer of oil on top.

Combine the dry ingredients.
