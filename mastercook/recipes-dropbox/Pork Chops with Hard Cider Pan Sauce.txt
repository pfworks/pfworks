--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        rub
  1         tablespoon  paprika
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  dry mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  8                     bone-in pork center rib chops -- 1 inch thick, trimmed
                        pan sauce
  1                cup  hard cider
     1/4           cup  dijon or creole mustard
  1         tablespoon  worcestershire sauce
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  2             dashes  tabasco sauce
     1/4           cup  heavy double cream

Mix the rub ingredients. Slash the edges of the pork chops in 2 or 3 places to prevent curling. Sprinkle the rub all over the chops and let stand for 15 minutes to 1 hour.

Coat the bottom of a large, heavy frying pan with the olive oil and heat over med-high heat. Add the chops in batches and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5-7 minutes longer, turning once or twice. Remove pork when it is 145. Transfer to a platter and let rest, tented loosely in foil.

To make the pan sauce, add the cider to the same pan and deglaze by scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Briing to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and whisk in the Dijon mustard, W sauce, tomato paste and tabasco. Cook for 2-3 minutes longer, whisking often. Remove from heat and whisk in cream. Taste and adjust seasoning.

Spoon sauce over chops and serve.
