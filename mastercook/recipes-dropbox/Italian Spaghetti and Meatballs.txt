--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              slice  white bread -- crusts removed
     1/3           cup  low-fat milk
  1              pound  lean ground sirloin
  1         tablespoon  onion -- finely chopped
  1         tablespoon  fresh parsley -- chopped
  1               each  egg
  3        tablespoons  Parmesan cheese -- freshly grated
  1              pinch  nutmeg -- freshly grated
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
  1                cup  dry bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1                cup  diced italian tomatoes
  2               cups  tomato sauce
  1              pound  spaghetti

Place the bread in a heatproof bowl. Heat the milk in the microwave and pour it over the bread. Mash the bread with a fork and let cool.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the beef, onion, parsley, egg, cheese, nutmeg, salt, pepper and bread mixture. Mix everything gently and thoroughly.

Gently shape the mixture into small round balls about 1 inch in diameter. Roll the meatballs in the bread crumbs.

Heat oil over med-high heat in a skillet large enough to accomodate all the meatballs in a single layer. Add meatballs to oil and brown on all sides.

Drain excess fat from pan. Turn the heat to medium and add the tomatoes and a pinch of salt. Turn meatballs to prevent sticking. Cover skillet and cook until tomatoes have thickened, about 25 minutes.

Add tomato sauce to skillet and heat.

Cook spaghetti and toss with meatballs and sauce.
