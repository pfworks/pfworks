                        vegetable oil spray
  1         tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
  1              pound  italian sausage -- casing removed
  2                     onion -- minced
  1                     green bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/2" pieces
  1                     red bell pepper -- stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1/2" pieces
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  28            ounces  crushed tomatoes
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
  8             ounces  ziti pasta
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  pepper
  15            ounces  tomato sauce
                        hot water
  1                cup  mozzarella cheese -- shredded

Line slow cooker with aluminum foil collar and coat with oil spray. Heat oil in large pot over med-high heat until just smoking. Brown sausage well, breaking up large pieces with wooden spoon, about 5 minutes. Add onions, bell peppers, garlic, and oregano and cook until vegetables are softened and lightly browned, 8-10 minutes.

Stir in tomatoes and heavy cream, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir in ziti, salt, and pepper.

Transfer ziti mixture in prepared slow cooker and spread tomato sauce evenly over pasta. Cover and cook until pasta is tender, about 3 hours on high.

Remove foil collar. Gently stir pasta, adding hot water as needed to loosen sauce consistency. Sprinkle with mozzarella, cover, and let sit until melted, about 5 minutes. Serve.
