--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  extra virgin olive oil
  1              large  egg
  2        tablespoons  panko
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4           cup  flat leaf parsley -- chopped
  1                cup  parmigiano-reggiano -- grated
                        kosher salt and pepper
  1              pound  ground beef chuck
  28            ounces  crushed tomatoes
  2                     8 oz balls of pizza dough -- room temp
  1                cup  basil leaf

Preheat oven to 450. Brush a large ceramic baking dish with olive oil. Whisk egg in a large bowl. Stir in panko, garlic, parsley, 1/4 cup of cheese, 1 tspn salt, and 1/2 tspn pepper. Add beef and gently knead. From into 1" meatballs and put into dish. Bake until browned, turning once, about 10 minutes.

In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add crushed tomatoes and cook over moderately high heat until bubbling.

Add meatballs to sauce, cover partially and simmer over low heat until meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes. With a large spoon, mash meatballs into large chunks. Remove from heat.

Brush 2 large baking sheets with olive oil and preheat in upper and lower thirds of the oven. On a lightly floured surface, cut each ball of dough in half. Roll each into a 10" round or oval. Arrange on heated baking sheets. Bake for about 7 minutes, shifting pans halfway through until browned on top.

Spread sauce over top, leaving a 1/4" border. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Bake for about 5 minutes. Scatter basil over top.
