--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  dark brown sugar
     1/4           cup  sweet paprika
  2        tablespoons  chile powder
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
                        salt and pepper
  5             pounds  boneless pork butt -- trimmed and quartered
  3                     smoked ham hocks -- rinsed
  2               cups  chicken broth
  1                cup  cider vinegar
     3/4           cup  ketchup
  1 1/2      teaspoons  liquid smoke flavoring

Combine 3 tablespoons sugar, paprika, chile powder, cumin, 2 tspns salt and 1 tablespoon pepper in bowl. Using fork, prick pork all over. Rub sugar mixture over pork, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 8-24 hours.

Place ham hocks in slow cooker. Unwrap pork and place on top of hocks. Pour broth over pork, cover and cook until pork is tender, 9-11 hours on low, or 5-7 hours on high.

Transfer pork and hocks to large bowl, let cool slightly, then shred into bite-size pieces, discarding skin, bones and excess fat; cover to keep warm. Let braising liquid settle for 5 minutes, then remove fat from surface.

Strain liquid into medium saucepan and simmer until thickened and measures 1 cup, 20-30 minutes. Whisk in vinegar, ketchup, liquid smoke, and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and bring to simmer. Season with salt and pepper.

Toss shredded pork with 1.5 cups sauce; add more sauce as needed to keep meat moist. Serve with remaining sauce.
