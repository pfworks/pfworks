                        New Mexican Rub
  2        tablespoons  ancho chile powder
  2        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  pasilla chile powder
  2          teaspoons  chile de arbol
  2          teaspoons  ground cinnamon
  2          teaspoons  allspice
                        Bourbon ancho sauce
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  red onion -- finely chopped
  2               cups  bourbon
  2        tablespoons  bourbon
  3                     ancho chiles -- soaked, seeded, stems removed and pureed
  6               cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  apple juice concentrate -- thawed
  8                     whole black peppercorn
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar
                        pork
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2             pounds  pork tenderloin
                        salt

Combine all rub ingredients.

Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over med-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft. Add the bourbon and cook until completely reduced. Add the remaining ingredients and cook until reduced by half. Strain through a fine mesh strainer, return mixture to pan, and cook to sauce consistency. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of bourbon and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.

Preheat oven to 400. Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Season pork with salt on both sides. Dredge pork in the spice rub and tap any excess. Sear on both sides until golden brown. Cook in oven to medium doneness, about 8 to 10 minutes.

Let pork rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 12 slices. Drizzle with Bourbon ancho sauce.
