  1               head  garlic -- peeled and crushed
  2          teaspoons  salt
  4             pounds  chuck roast -- 3" thick
     1/2           cup  chile powder (ancho or red)
                        mesquite chips or beans
  4             slices  bacon -- chopped
  1              large  onion -- chopped
  2               cups  beef stock
  1         tablespoon  cumin seed -- toasted and ground
  1         tablespoon  mole paste
  2          teaspoons  mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  cider vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  ground chile (arbol or pequin)
  2        tablespoons  masa harina

2-3 hours before making chili, use a mortar and pestle to make a paste of 6 garlic cloves and the 1.5 teaspoons of the salt. Rub meat with paste and sprinkle on about 1 teaspoon of chile powder.

On an outdoor grill, fire up enough charcoal to form a single layer of coals beneath meat. Soak a few handfulls of mesquite in water. When the coals are covered in gray ash, spread them out evenly and scatter mesquite on top. Place meat directly over coals. Cover, and cook for 10 minutes a side for flavor. Remove and let cool to handle.

When meat has cooled, trim away fat and cartilage. Cut meat into 1/4" or 1/2" cubes, saving all the juices.

In a dutch oven or small stockpot, cook bacon over medium heat until browned. Remove bacon from drippings with slotted spoon. Add onion to drippings and saute brifly until softened. Mix in remaining garlic and saute until translucent. Stir in the meat and all reserved juices, adding just enough beef stock to cover. Stir in remaining salt and red chile, the reserved bacon and the cumin, mole paste, oregano, vinegar and hot red chile. Reduce heat to very low.

Cook for about 3 hours, stirring every 1/2 hour and adjusting seasoning. Add stock as needed to keep from getting dry. In the third hout of cooking, thicken by adding masa harina 1 or 2 teaspoons at a time.

You can serve right away, but the flavor improves by refrigerating overnight and reheating.
