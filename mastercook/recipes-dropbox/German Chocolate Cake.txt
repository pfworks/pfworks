                        cake
  3             ounces  milk chocolate -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  dutch-process cocoa powder
     1/3           cup  boiling water
  1 1/3           cups  all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/2           cup  brown sugar -- packed
     1/3           cup  granulated sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  3              large  egg -- room temp
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2           cup  low-fat sour cream -- room temp
                        frosting
  1                cup  fat-free evaporated milk
  3        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     2/3           cup  brown sugar -- packed
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/3           cup  pecans -- toasted and chopped fine
     1/2           cup  sweetened coconut flakes -- toasted

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350. Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans. Whisk chocolate, cocoa, and boiling water in bowl until smooth; let cool. Combine flour and baking soda in separate bowl. With electric mixer on med-low, beat butter, sugars and salt until combined. Increase speed to medium and beat until mixture lightens in color and sticks to sides of bowl, about 1 minute. Scrape down bowl, then add eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until well combined, about 45 seconds. Reduce speed to low and add chocolate mixture and vanilla until incorporated. Add flour mixture in three additions, alternating with 2 additions of sour cream, and mix until just combined.

Divide batter into prepared pans and bake until toothpick comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Cool cakes in pans 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire rack and cool completely, at least 1 hour.

Whisk evaporated milk, cornstarch, butter, brown sugar, and salt in saucepan over med-high heat until bubbling, about 3 minutes. Continue to cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in vanilla and all but 1 tbspn each of pecans and coconut. Cool to room temp.

Place 1 cake round on serving platter. Spread with half of frosting, then top with second cake. Spread remaining frosting over top of cake, then sprinkle with pecans and coconut.
