  1                     egg -- beaten with a fork

  2             ounces  dried ancho chiles (about 3)
  2             ounces  dried cascabel chiles (about 15)
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1                     white onion -- peeled and diced
  2        tablespoons  chipotle chile canned in adobo -- pureed
  1 1/2           cups  beef broth
  3             cloves  garlic -- roasted, peeled and finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  cumin -- toasted and ground
  2          teaspoons  mexican oregano
  1           teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil or lard

Sauce: Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise and place skin side up on a baking sheet. Broil until blackened, about 5 minutes.

Wash, stem and seed the chiles and place on a separate baking sheet. Bake at 250 for 2 to 3 minutes. Shake occasionally and do not allow to blacken. Transfer to a large bowl and add enough boiling water to just cover. Allow to stand for 20-30 minutes until they are soft. Drain chiles and discard liquid.

Heat the oil in a skillet and saute onion over medium heat until well browned.

In a food processor or blender, puree all the ingredients, except lard, to a fine paste, adding more broth if needed.

Heat lard or oil in a heavy saucepan until just smoking. Fry the sauce for 3-5 minutes, stirring continuously. If sauce is too thick, add broth.

Steak: Lay the steak out on a flat surface with the shortest side of the meat in front of you. The grain of the meat will be running north and south. Holding a long, sharp knife, slice the steak in half making little slices through the center from one side to the other, until you reach 1/2" from the opposite side. Open the steak like a book, cover with a large piece of plastic wrap, and flatten with a meat mallet. Feel the surface with your hand and pound the steak to make sure it is evenly thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Add the bell pepper, corn, beans and cheese and combine. Remove from the heat and stir in the egg, chipotle powder, cumin, salt and pepper. Set aside.

With the grain of the meat running east-west, spread the filling on the steak to within an inch of the edges all the way around. Roll the meat up over the filling into a nice, tight roll. Secure the roll by tying kitchen string at 2" intervals around the rolled steak. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 450. Position a rack one level up from the middle. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the steak roll on all sides and then move it to a foil-covered sheet pan. Roast the meat for 15-20 minutes, until the center is med-rare.

When the meat is cooked, remove it from the oven and let stand 7-10 minutes. Slice the meat into 1/2" slices and serve with Red Chile Sauce.
