                        Carolina Mustard Sauce
  1                     pork loin
  6                     bacon strips
  1                cup  pecans -- finely chopped
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  pepper

Cut the tenderloin into 6 long strips about 1/4" thick. Lay the slices on a cutting board; they should be the same size and length as the bacon strips. Place a strip of bacon on top of each piece of tenderloin. Roll into a pinwheel medallion and secure with 2 toothpicks.

Set aside 1 cup of the mustard sauce and apply remaining sauce to the ouside of the pinwheels. Stir together pecans, salt and pepper and coat the pinwheels. Cut each pinwheel through the equator to make 2 thin medallions.

Place medallions on grill and cook for 7-8 minutes per side or until bacon starts to crisp. Serve with reserved sauce drizzled over each pinwheel.
