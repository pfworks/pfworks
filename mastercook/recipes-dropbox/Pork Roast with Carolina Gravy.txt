  4             medium  leeks
  1                     5-6 lb bone-in pork shoulder roast
                        kitchen string
  2          teaspoons  salt
  2          teaspoons  pepper
  3              thick  bacon slices -- chopped
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  10            cloves  garlic -- halved
  3             medium  onion -- halved and sliced
  2 1/2           cups  chicken broth
     1/2           cup  dry white wine
  10                    fresh thyme sprigs
  4                     bay leaves
  1         tablespoon  butter

Preheat oven to 350. Remove and discard root ends and dark green tops of leeks. Thinly slice leeks; rinse well and drain.

Tie roast with string, securing at 2 inch intervals. Season with salt and pepper.

Cook bacon in hot oil in an ovenproof Dutch oven or large, deep cast iron skillet over med-high heat for 3 minutes. Add leeks, garlic, and onions and cook, stirring frequently, 15 to 17 minutes or until mixture is golden brown; transfer to a bowl.

Add pork roast, fat side down and cook 2 minutes on all sides or until browned. Remove pork.

Return leek mixture to Dutch oven; top with pork. Add broth and next 3 ingredients. Reduce heat to medium, and bring to a light boil. Remove from heat, and cover with heavy-duty foil.

Bake at 350 for 3 to 3.5 hours or until 180-185. Remove pork from Dutch oven, cover with foil and let stand 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour pan juices through a wire mesh sieve into a saucepan to equal 4 cups, discarding solids. Let stand 5 minutes; skim fat from surface of juices.

Bring to a boil over med-high heat, and cook 20 to 25 minutes or until liquid is reduced to 1 cup and slightly thickened. Remove from heat, and stir in butter until melted. Serve with pork.
