  2              large  poblano pepper -- halved and seeded
  2                     plum tomato -- cored and halved
  1              small  onion -- quartered
  3             cloves  garlic -- unpeeled
                        kosher salt
  4                     hamburger bun
  1              large  egg white -- lightly beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  dried cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  chile powder
  1 1/2         pounds  ground beef chuck
  6             slices  muenster cheese

Preheat the broiler. Put the poblanos cut side down on a foil lined pan. Add the tomatoes, onion and garlic and broil until charred, 7-8 minutes. Cool slightly, then peel the garlic. Chop the garlic, onion and tomatoes; toss in a bowl with salt to taste. Peel the poblanos and cut each in half.

Preheat oven to 350. Brush bun tops with the egg white. Mix the oregano, cumin and chile powder, sprinkle on the bun tops, and put the tops and bottoms on a baking sheet. Bake 5 minutes.

Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Shape the beed into four 3/4 inch thick patties; make an indentation in the center of each. Sprinkle skillet with salt then cook the burgers until browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip, then top each with some of the tomato mixture and cheese. Cover and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Serve on spiced buns with the poblanos and remaining mixture.
