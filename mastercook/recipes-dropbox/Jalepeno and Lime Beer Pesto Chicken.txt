     1/3           cup  pine nut
  3             cloves  garlic -- roughly chopped
  3                     jalepeno -- roughly chopped
     1/2           cup  extra virgin olive oil
     1/2           cup  lime beer
     1/2           cup  parmesan-reggiano -- freshly grated

  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast

Preheat grill to 350.

Make the pesto: Place basil and pine nuts in a food processor and pulse a few times. Add garlic and jalapenos and pulse a few times. While processor is on, add oil in a slow, constant stream, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Add beer and cheese and pulse again until blended. Add a pinch of salt and pepper.

Brush the beer pesto onto the chicken and grill until 165.
