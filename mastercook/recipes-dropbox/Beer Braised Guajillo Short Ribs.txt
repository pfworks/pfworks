  8                     beef short ribs
                        salt and pepper
  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- sliced
  4                     guajillo chiles -- seeded and sliced
  12            ounces  mexican beer
  1         tablespoon  masa harina

Season ribs heavily with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the oil and sear the ribs on all sides until nicely browned. Add garlic and chiles and saute for 1 minute.

Deglaze pot with beer, scraping up brown bits. Simmer for 2 minutes. Cover and braise on the stove over low heat for 6 hours or until falling off bone. Uncover pot and remove all meat and ribs from pot. Pick meat from the bones and set aside.

Strain the sauce in the pot into a large bowl and discard chile, garlic and bones. Add sauce back to pot along with the masa harina. Whisk to combine and simmer until thickened. Season with salt and pepper and serve over meat.
