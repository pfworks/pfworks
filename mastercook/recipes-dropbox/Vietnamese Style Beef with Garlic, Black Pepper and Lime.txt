--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  soy sauce
  2        tablespoons  fresh lime juice
  1 1/2    tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  fish sauce
  5             cloves  garlic -- minced
  3        tablespoons  peanut or canola oil
                        kosher salt and black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  beef tenderloin -- 3/4" pieces
  1             medium  yellow onion -- 1/4" wedges
  3        tablespoons  salted peanuts -- chopped and toasted
  2                     scallion -- thinly sliced

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, lime juice, sugar and fish sauce; stir until sugar dissolved. In another small bowl, stir the garlic, 1.5 tspns of the oil, and 1.5 tspns pepper.

Season the beef with salt and pepper. In a 12" nonstick skillet, heat 1.5 tspns oil over med-high heat until shimmering. Swirl to coat skillet. Add half the beef in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until well browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Using tongs, turn the pieces over and brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add 1.5 tspns oil to the skillet and repeat.

Put the remaining 1.5 tspns oil in skillet and heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the beef and onions are coated and the sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.

Serve sprinkled with peanuts and scallions.
