  4             slices  bacon -- minced
  1 1/3           cups  scallion -- thinly sliced
  3             stalks  celery -- minced
  4                 in  ginger -- peeled and minced
  7             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1              pound  ground beef
  1              pound  ground pork
  2              large  eggs -- beaten to blend
  3                     whole star anise or 1 tspn chinese 5 spice powder -- finely ground
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper

For glaze: Bring all ingredients to a boil in a medium saucepan; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens to a glaze, 8-10 minutes.

Meatloaf: Preheat oven to 375. Coat the bottom and sides of loaf pan with spray. In a large bowl, soak bread cubes in chicken broth, stirring frequently, until liquid is absorbed and bread is beginning to fall apart, 4-5 minutes. Cook bacon in a large, heavy skillet over medium heat until fat is rendered and bacon is starting to crisp. Add scallions(white and pale green parts only), celery, ginger, and garlic; cook, stirring often, until vegetables begin to soften, 3-4 minutes. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes.

Combine scallion and bread mixtures in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons hoisin glaze, remaining scallions (dark green parts), beef, pork and remaining 4 ingredients. Using hands, work all ingredients together until very well incorporated and mixture is starts to get sticky. Pack mixture into prepared pan, pressing to eliminate any air pockets and mounding in center. Cover with foil. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil; place loaf pan on top.

Bake meatloaf for 30 mintues. Uncover and spread 2 tablespoons glaze over top. Bake until 165, about 1 hour longer.

Let rest for 20 minutes before removing.
