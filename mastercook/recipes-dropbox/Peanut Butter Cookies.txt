  4 1/2           cups  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1           teaspoon  salt
  3             sticks  unsalted butter -- softened
  1 1/3           cups  creamy peanut butter
     2/3           cup  granulated sugar
  2 1/4           cups  packed brown sugar
     1/3           cup  vegetable oil

Preheat oven to 350 with racks in upper and lower thirds.

Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl.

Beat together butter, peanut butter, sugars and oil with an electric mixer at high speed just untl pale and creamy. Add whole eggs, yolks, and vanilla and beat until just incorporated. Reduce speed to low, then add flour mixture in 3 batches, mixing until well incorporated.

Bake, switching positions of sheets halfway through until slightly puffed and golden around the edges, about 30 minutes total. Transfer to racks and cool.

Switch rack to middle and cook remaining cookies.
