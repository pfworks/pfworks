Holding both ends of a banana leaf, drag leaf over a burner on high heat until it changes color slightly and becomes shinier, then turn over and toast the other side. Toast remaining in same manner.

Line roasting pan with leaves, shiner sides down, by arranging 1 leaf lengthwise and 2 crosswise, letting excess hang over sides. Trim overhang to about 8 inches on all sides.

Instead of seville orange juice, you can use 1/4 cup fresh orange juice, and 1/4 cup lime juice.
