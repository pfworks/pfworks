                        canola oil
  4               cups  rice flour
                        fine salt
                        freshly cracked black pepper
  1              bunch  chives -- minced
  4              large  red onion -- sliced paper-thin

Fill a large pot 1/3 full with oil and heat to 350. Line a plate with paper towels. Place the flour in a large bag or bowl. Add the onions, toss well to coat and shake off excess flour. Fry the onions until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove to the plate and immediately sprinkle generously with salt and a touch of pepper. Top with chives.
