--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  whole milk
     1/2           cup  sugar
  4 1/2      teaspoons  active dry yeast
  3               cups  flour
  3               cups  bread flour
  9              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  1 1/2           cups  butter -- 1 in pieces

Heat milk in a small pot over med-low heat until just warm. Add 1/4 cup of the sugar and swirl to dissolve. Add the yeast and transfer to bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let sit for a few minutes until foamy.

Whisk flour, bread flour, and remaining sugar in a medium bowl. Add 8 eggs to the milk mixture, followed by half of flour. Mix on low. Add rest of flour and mix.

Turn up speed to medium and knead until smooth, 4-6 minutes. Add salt and knead until springy and elastic, 4-6 minutes.

Add butter, a few pieces at a time, fully incorporating each one before continuing, and scraping as needed. It will take 30-40 minutes to incorporate all butter.

Continue kneading another 5-7 minutes. It should be well emulsified and feel a but sticky.

Lightly grease a large bowl and transfer dough. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough has doubled in size and firmed up, 12-24 hours. Turn out onto floured surface and divide into 2.

Flatten each piece into an 8x5 rectangle, about 1 inch thick. Working from the longer edge at the top, tightly roll the dough, pressing seam each time. Pinch dough at last roll and tuck the ends other and pinch.

Transfer dough to a greased 8.5 x 4.5 pan, seam side down for both pieces.

Tightly wrap both pans with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft free place. Let dough rise until touching wrap and breaking out, about 2 hours.

Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 375. Beat egg with 1 tspn water and brush it over tops of dough.

Place pans in oven and bake, rotating halfway through, until tops and sides are deep golden brown and baked through completely, 50-65 minutes. (200 degrees).

Remove from oven and remove from pans. Place on wire rack to cool completely.
