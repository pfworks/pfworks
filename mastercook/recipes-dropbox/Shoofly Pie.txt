                        Crust
  2               cups  all-purpose flour
  1           teaspoon  salt
     3/4           cup  shortening
  5        tablespoons  water
                        Filling
     1/2           cup  dark corn syrup
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar -- packed
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2           cup  hot water
                        Topping
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3        tablespoons  shortening

  1              pinch  salt

In a medium bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut shortening into mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water until combined. Press together to form dough and chill for 1 hour up to overnight. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/8" thickness; fit into a 9" pie pan. Preheat oven to 350.

Combine corn syrup, brown sugar and egg. Dissolve baking soda in hot water, stir into syrup mixture, and pour into crust.

In a medium bowl, mix topping ingredients with fingers or pastry blender until combined. Sprinkle over syrup. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes.
