Add the basil and season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 1 minute. Set aside and keep warm.

To make chops: Preheat oven to 400. Season chops with salt and pepper. and dust each with flour.

Whisk the eggs and 2 tablespoons of water in a shallow bowl and put bread crumbs in another bowl.

Dip the chops in the egg wash to coat on both sides and the dip into the bread crumbs to completely coat.

In a 10" saute pan, heat oil over medium heat. When hot, cook the chops for about 2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Transfer to a shallow baking pan.

Bake for 8-9 minutes. Turn and bake for an additional 8-9 minutes or until cooked through to 145.
