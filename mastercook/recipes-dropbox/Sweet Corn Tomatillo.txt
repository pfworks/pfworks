  5        tablespoons  butter -- softened
     1/4           cup  masa harina
     1/3           cup  sugar
  2               cups  corn kernels
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2        tablespoons  milk

In a small bowl, mix butter, masa, and sugar using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 1 minute.

Blend half the corn kernels with the water in a blender until smooth. Combine this with the butter mixture, stirring well. Add the remaining corn kernels, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and milk and mix well.

Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Pour the corn mixture into an 8 inch square baking dish. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and set atop the saucepan of boiling water. Keep pan tightly wrapped and steam for 50 minutes to 1 hour until a toothpick comes out clean.
