--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        pork
  2          teaspoons  ground coriander
  1           teaspoon  garlic powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
  2                     pork tenderloins (12 oz each) -- silver skin removed
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
                        kosher salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        sauce
     1/4           cup  pure maple syrup
  2        tablespoons  sherry vinegar
  2        tablespoons  chipotle hot sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  kosher salt

Position a rack closest to the broiler and preheat to high. Combine the coriander, garlic powder and ginger. Brush the tenderloins with the oil and rub all over with the spices. Season with salt and pepper. Lay the pork on a small shallow pan and broil until golden, turning once, about 5 minutes per side. (130)

Meanwhile, the sauce. Whisk the syrup, vinegar, hot sauce and salt together in a small bowl. Set aside half the sauce. Generously brush the tenderloins all over with the remaining sauce. Return to broiler and cook, turning once, until a deep, rich brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside meat for 5 minutes. Serve with reserved sauce drizzled on meat.
