     3/4      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  extra virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  dark sesame oil
  1           teaspoon  dijon mustard

Fill a large bowl with ice and water; set aside. Add broccoli to boiling water; stir for one minute. Drain then plunge into ice bath. When cool, drain well; toss with sesame seeds. Pack into containers with a small container of vinaigrette.
