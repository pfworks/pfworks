  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  water -- room temp
  1         tablespoon  water -- room temp
  1 1/2      teaspoons  rapid-rise or instant yeast
  2          teaspoons  honey
  3               cups  bread flour
  1         tablespoon  bread flour
  3        tablespoons  whole wheat flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

Whisk the water, yeast and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer until combined. Add the flours and mix on low speed with a dough hook until a cohesive dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temp for 30 minutes.

Remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the salt over the dough. Knead on low speed for 5 minutes. Increase speed to medium and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky, about 1 minute. If the dough is sticky, add 1 to 2 tbspns of flour and continue mixing for 1 minute. Lightly spray a 2-qt bowl with nonstick cooking spray; transfer the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

Fold the dough over itself; rotate the bowl 90 degrees and fold again. Repeat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise 30 minutes. Repeat. Spray 2 9 inch round cake pans with nonstick spray and set aside.

Transfer dough to floured counter and sprinkle with more flour. Using a bench scraper, cut the dough in half and gently stretch each half into a 16" cylinder. Cut each cylinder into quarters, then each quarter into 2 pieces, and dust the top of each piece with more flour. With floured hands, gently roll each piece in your palms to coat with flour, shaking off any excess. Arrange 8 dough pieces in each cake pan, placing 1 in middle and the others around it, cut side up. Loosely cover pans with plastic wrap and let rise about 30 minutes. Thirty minutes before baking, adjust rack to middle position and heat oven to 500.

Remove wrap from pans, mist rolls lightly with water, and place in the oven. Bake for 10 minutes, until tops are brown; remove from oven. Reduce to 400; using mitts or towels invert rolls from both pans onto a rimmed baking sheet. When the rolls are cool enough to handle, turn them right side up, pull them apart, and space them evenly on the sheet. Continue to bake until they develop a deep golden brown crust and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 10 to 15 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through. Transfer to wire rack and cool 1 hour.
