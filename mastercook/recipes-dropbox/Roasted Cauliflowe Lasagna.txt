Heat remaining tablespoon of oil with 4 cloves sliced garlic and 1/2 tspn salt in a small dutch oven over medium heat until the garlic begins to sizzle and becomes aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add bell pepper and cook, stirring, until soft, about 8 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir to incorporate, about 40 seconds. Add the crushed tomatoes with their juice and 4 large leaves of basil. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 40 minutes. ou should have about 3 3/4 cups of sauce.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook lasagna al dente. 

Combine ricotta, egg, 1.5 cups of roasted caulilower, and 1 chopped garlic clove in a food processor and pulse until evenlu pureed.Tear remaining basil into small pieces, add to processor, and pulse 3-4 more times to chop basil. Transfer to medium bowl.

Spread a thin layer of sauce (around 1/4 cup) on the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Lay 4 of the noodles on the bottom. Spread half of the cauliflower-ricotta mixture, followed by half of the cauliflower, one third of tomato sauce, one third of mozarella and one third of parmesan. Fit 3 more noodles on top without overlapping. Spread with remaining cauliflower-ricotta mixture followed by the remaining cauliflower, one third of tomato sauce, mozarella and parmesan. Top with remaining 4 noodles and add remaining sauce, mozarella and parmesan. Cover with foil and bake until bubbly and hot, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and cook until cheese begins to brown, about 10 minutes more. Let rest for 10 minutes and garnish with parsley.
