--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  chopped bacon
  6               cups  yellow onion -- finely sliced
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1         tablespoon  serrano pepper -- finely chopped
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  flour
  12            ounces  shiner bock beer
  4               cups  veal stock (or chicken stock)

  1              piece  cayenne

Render the bacon until it is crisp over medium high heat in a moderately hot Dutch oven or saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add onions and cover. Cook until the onions are tender, 5-7 minutes. Uncover, then add garlic, serrano, and butter. Stir until carmelized, about 10 minutes.

Add flour, stirring to thicken, but don't aloow it to stick; then add beer. Turn up heat, bring to a boil, and add stock.

Season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking another 5-10 minutes. Add a pinch of cayenne.
