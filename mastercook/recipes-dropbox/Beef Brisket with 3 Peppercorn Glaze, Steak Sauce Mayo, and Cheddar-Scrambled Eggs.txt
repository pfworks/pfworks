  12             large  eggs -- whisked until smooth
  4             ounces  aged cheddar -- grated
                        kosher salt and pepper
                        Steak Sauce Mayo
     3/4           cup  mayonnaise
  6        tablespoons  molasses
  3        tablespoons  ketchup
  3        tablespoons  prepared horseradish -- drained
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  2        tablespoons  whole grain mustard
  1         tablespoon  honey
                        kosher salt and pepper
			
                        kettle BBQ chips -- crushed
  8                     soft hoagie rolls

Preheat oven to 350.

Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until it begins to shimmer. Pat the meat dry on both sides with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Sear in the oil until golden brown on both sides. Remove to baking sheet.

Add the onions and carrots to the pot and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the beer and cook until reduced by half. Return the brisket to the pot and add enough chicken stock to comie halfway up the sides. Add the bay, thyme, and parsley and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven. Cook until fork tender, about 3 hours. Remove to a baking sheet.

While the brisket is cooking, combine the sugar and vinegar in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook until thickened and reduced to about 3/4 cup. Let cool slightly.

Preheat broiler. Brush the top of the brisket with some of the glaze, top with crushed peppercorns, and broil until the glaze bubbles.

Steak Sauce Mayo: Whisk together all ingredients, season with salt and pepper, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Eggs: Melt the butter in a large, nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the eggs and cook until soft peaks form. Fold in the cheese, remove from heat and season with salt and pepper.

Sandwiches. Slice brisket across the grain. Spead Steak Sauce Mayo on the insides of the rolls. Pile brisket on top and drizzle some glaze. Top with eggs and crushed chips.
