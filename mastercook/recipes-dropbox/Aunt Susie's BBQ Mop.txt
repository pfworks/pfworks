  3               cans  beef broth (14.5 oz cans)
  3                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  oregano
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  onion -- diced
     1/4           cup  celery -- diced
  8             cloves  garlic -- minced
  3        tablespoons  Aunt Susie's BBQ Rub
     1/4      teaspoon  cayenne pepper
  1              pound  bacon
  2                     lemons - zest finely grated and juiced
  3        tablespoons  soy sauce
  3        tablespoons  vinegar
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame oil
  3        tablespoons  bourbon

Bring the broth, bay leaves and oregano to a boil in a large kettle. Reduce heat to a simmer. Melt butter in a skillet, and add the onions, celery, garlic, BBQ Rub, and cayenne. Cook until browned, about 7 minutes. In another pan fry the bacon, in batches, until crisp. Drain and crumble. Add to the simmering broth, along with the cooked onion mixture, the lemon zest and juice, soy sauce, vinegar, olive oil, sesame oil and bourbon. Mix well. Simmer until the sauce is reduced by 1 quarter, about an hour.
