--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              dried  chile de arbol
  1                cup  fresh pineapple -- chopped
     1/2           cup  distilled white vinegar
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- smashed
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1              pound  tomatoes -- halved
  1              small  white onion -- quartered
  3        tablespoons  water
     1/4           cup  cilantro -- chopped
                        kebobs
  2             pounds  boneless pork shoulder -- 1.5" cubes
  1              large  white onion -- 1.5" pieces
  3               cups  fresh pineapple -- 1" chunks
  16                    corn tortilla

Heat a dry small heavy skillet over medium heat until hot, then toast chiles, turning and pressing with tongs, until more pliable and slightly changed in color, about 30 seconds. Stem chiles. Puree 1 chile in a blender with pineapple, vinegar, oil, garlic, oregano, cumin and 1.75 tsp salt, then transfer to a bowl.

Oil a small baking pan, then add tomatoes and onion. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat, turning occasionally, until tomatoes are wilted, skins are blistered, and onions begin to soften and are charred in spots, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to a blender. Add remaining 2 chiles, water and 1 tsp salt and puree until smooth. Add cilantro and 1/2 cup pineapple basting sauce and pulse until cilantro is finely chopped.

Toss pork with remaining basting sauce, then thread pork, onion and pineapple onto skewers, leaving room between pieces.

Grill skewers, turning and basting with sauce until pork is cooked, 8 to 10 minutes.

Serve with warm tortillas and salsa.
