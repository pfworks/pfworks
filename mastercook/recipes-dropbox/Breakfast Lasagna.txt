Preheat oven to 400. Place a wire cooling rack over a baking tray and line rack with bacon strips. Bake until crispy, 20-25 minutes.

Reduce heat to medium. Add flour, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk, scraping up any browned bits. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.

Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and pour fat into a medium saucepan. Leave oven on. Heat fat over medium-high heat and whisk in flour until combined. Add maple syrup and cream and bring to a boil while stirring. Continue to cook until it thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.

Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium. Rub with oiled paper towel. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto skiller in an 8 inch strip. Cook until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook 1-2 more minutes. Transfer to a platter and cook all 8.

Eggs: Whisk eggs ans salt together in a large bowl. Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. When foam sibsides, add eggs and stir until almost cooked but still runny in parts, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in ricotta.

To assemble, butter a 9x13 casserole dish. Place 4 pancake slices crosswise, side by side in bottom of pan. Spread 1/2 cup of maple sauce, top with half the eggs, sprinkle half the cheddar and top with half of the gravy. Repeat. Arrange bacon on top.
