     1/2           cup  all-purpose flour
                        Cheesecake crust dough
  7           packages  8 oz cream cheese -- room temp
  2 1/4           cups  sugar
  1                cup  sour cream -- room temp
  1 1/2      teaspoons  pure vanilla extract
  5              large  eggs -- room temp
                        unsalted butter -- softened
                        boiling water

Preheat oven to 350. On a lightly floured surface, roll out cheesecake crust dough slightly thicker than 1/8 inch. Place the base of a 10 inch springform pan on top as a guide, then cut out the dough. Slide dough onto base.

Attach sides to pan; wrap exterior of pan (including base) in a double layer of foil. Freeze dough in pan for 15 minutes.

Transfer pan to a baking sheet. Bake dough until golden, about 18 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack, and let crust cool. Leave oven on.

Put cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle. Mix on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes.

Stir together sugar and flour in a large bowl. With mixer on low speed, add sugar mixture to bowl in a slow, steady stream; mix until smooth. Add sour cream and vanilla, mix until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing until just combined. (do not overmix)

Butter sides of cake pan. Pour cream cheese filling over crust. Set pan inside a large, shallow roasting pan. Transfer to oven. Carefully ladle boiling water into roasting pan to reach halfway up sides of pan.

Bake 45 minutes; reduce oven temperature to 325. Continue to bake until cake is golden and set but still slightly wobbly in center, about 30 minutes more. Turn oven off; leave cake in oven with door slightly ajar, 1 hour.

Transfer cake pan to rack; let cake cool completely. Refrigeratre, uncovered, 6 hours or overnight. Run knife around edge of cake before unmolding.
