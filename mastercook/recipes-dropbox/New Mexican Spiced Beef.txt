--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  10            cloves  garlic -- peeled
  8        tablespoons  pickling spice
  3        tablespoons  meat tenderizer
  3        tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  cinnamon
  1         tablespoon  ground cumin
  3        tablespoons  coriander seed
  1           teaspoon  hot red chile powder
  5             pounds  boned beef brisket

In a blender or food processor, puree the garlic, pickling spices, tenderizer, sugar, salt, cinnamon, cumin, coriander and chile to a granular consistency. Trim as much fat from the brisket as possible and rub both sides with the spice mixture. Wrap the brisket thouroughly in the following manner: Cover completely with waxed paper and secure with masking tape, then with brown paper (or a cut up grocery bag) sealed with tape, then with a layer of foil. Now place in plastic bags or seal tightly with several layers of platic wrap. Secure with more tape. Store on bottom shelf of refrigerator for 14-21 days.

On serving day, preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Unwrap the brisket and place in a shallow baking pan with a small amount of water, not enough to cover the brisket. Cover the pan lightly with foil and cook for 2-3 hours - depending on thickness of brisket - until the meat is cooked through. It shoould not be rare.

Place the spiced beef on a serving platter. When cool, carve it into very thin slices. Serve the beef with a selection of mustards and breads.
