--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Masa
  2 1/2           cups  masa harina
  1 1/2           cups  hot water
  1                cup  cold lard
  2          teaspoons  baking powder
  1 1/2      teaspoons  kosher salt
  1                cup  cold chicken stock
                        Red Chile Braised Pork
  10                    guajillo chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  10            cloves  garlic
  2                     canned chipotle in adobo sauce
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
  3             pounds  boneless pork shoulder
                        kosher salt

Masa: In a large bowl, stir the masa harina with the water until evenly moistened; let cool. In the bowl of an electric standing mixer fitted with paddle, beat the lard with baking powder and salt at medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes. With the machine on, add the masa in golf-ball sized lumps, then drizzle in the chicken stock and beat until completely smooth. Increase speed to high and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes; the texture should resemble soft hummus.

Red Chile Pork: Using tongs, briefly toast guajillo chiles until fragrant, 5 seconds per side. Transfer to blender. Add 2 cups of hot water and let stand for 15 minutes.

Add garlic, chipotles, black pepper, cinnamon and oregano to the blender and puree. Strain into a large enameled cast iron casserole, pressing on the solids. Add the pork and 6 cups of hot water to the casserole; bring to a boil. Cover partially, and simmer over low heat until tender, about 2 hours.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer pork to a bowl and let cool slightly. Boil sauce until reduced to 4 cups, about 20 minutes.

Shred pork with two forks and return to sauce. Simmer until sauce is reduced and just covers pork, about 20 minutes. Season with salt and let cool slightly.

Tamal Pie: Preheat oven to 300 and grease a 10 inch cast iron skillet with lard. Spoon two thirds of Masa into the skiller, mounding it slightly up the side. Spread 2.5 cups red chile pork evenly over masa and top with remaining masa. Bake for 30 minutes, until nearly set. Increase temperature to 375 and bake until firm and lightly browned, about 35 minutes longer. Let stand for 30 minutes, then cut into wedges and serve.
