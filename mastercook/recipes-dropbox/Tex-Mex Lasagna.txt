In a 9 inch skiller, heat 1/2 cup olive oil on med heat until sizzling but not smoking. Cook tortillas, one at a time, for 5 seconds on each side. Remove to paper towel lined plate.

In dish, arrange 4 tortillas in one layer, overlapping slightly. Spread half of bean mixture and top with half of meat mixture. Spread 1/3 of cheese over meat and half of sauce over cheese. Repeat. Top with remaining 4 tortillas and cheese. Bake on middle rack for 35 minutes. Let cool 10-15 minutes.
