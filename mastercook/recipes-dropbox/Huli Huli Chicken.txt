  3                     6 oz cans pineapple juice
     1/4           cup  light brown sugar -- packed
     1/4           cup  soy sauce
     1/4           cup  ketchup

  2               cups  wood chips -- soaked for 15 minutes and drained

Chicken: Combine the soy sauce and 2 quarts cold water in a large bowl. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over med-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir into the soy sauce mixture. Add the chicken and refrigerate, covered, for 1 to 8 hours.

Glaze: Combine pineapple juice, sugar, soy sauce, ketchup, vinegar, garlic, ginger and chile-garlic sauce in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until thick and syrupy, 20 to 25 minutes. Seal the soaked wood chips in aluminum foil and poke vent holes in the top.

For charcoal: Open bottom vents halfway. Light a large chimney with 3/4 full. When hot, spread evenly. Place wood chip packet on top of coals. Set grate in place and cover, and open lid vents halfway. Heat the grill until hot and the chips begin to smoke heavily, about 5 minutes.

Gas: Place wood chip packet directly on primary burner. Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat until hot and wood chips smoke heavily, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to med-low.

Clean and oil grate. Remove chicken from brine and pat dry. Arrange chicken skin side up on the grill, but not directly over packet. Grill, covered until well browned and thickest part of thigh registers 120, 25 to 30 minutes. Flip chicken and grill, covered until skin is well browned and crisp, and thigh registers 175 and breat 160 to 165, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to platter, brush with half the glaze and let rest 5 minutes. Server with the rest of the glaze.
