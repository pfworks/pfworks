Arrange bell peppers, cut sides down, in a shallow baking pan.

Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat until blackened and beginning to soften, about 15 minutes.

Cover pan tightly with foil and let stand, covered, until cool enough to handle, 10 to 15 minutes. Peel peppers and cut lengthwise into 1/2" wide strips.

Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 400. Lightly oil 13x9 gratin dish.

Stir together parsley, thyme, rosemary, zest, salt and pepper in a bowl. Toss bread cubes with chees and oil in another bowl.

Arrange half of tomatoes in gratin dish, overlapping slices and alternating colors, then spread half of pepper strips on top. Sprinkle with half of herb mixture and 2 cups bread mixture. Repeat, ending with bread mixture.

Bake until vegetables are bubbling and topping is golden brown, 35 to 45 minuters, covering with foil if break browns too quickly.

Cool to warm or room temp.
