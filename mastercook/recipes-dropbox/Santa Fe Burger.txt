                        burgers
  1              large  poblano pepper
  2 1/2    tablespoons  canola oil
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  1 1/2         pounds  ground chuck (80%)
  4                     hamburger buns -- split and toasted
  12                    blue or yellow corn chips
                        queso sauce
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  all-purpose flour
  1 1/2           cups  whole milk
  8             ounces  monterey jack cheese -- grated
                        kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 375.

Put the chile on a rimmed baking sheet, rub with 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast in the oven until the skin of the chile is blackened, about 15 minutes. Remove the chile from the oven, place in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let the chile steam for 15 minutes. Peel, stem, and seed the chile and then coarsely chop it.

To make the queso sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 mintue. Add the milk, increase the heat to high, and cook, whishking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the cheese until melted; season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.

Divide the meat into 4 equal portions. Form each portion loosely into a 3/4" thick burger and make a deep depression in the center with your thumb. Season both sides of burger with salt and pepper. Cook the burgers, using the remaining 1.5 tbspns of oil.

Place burgers on the bun bottoms and top each with a few tablespoons of queso sauce, chips and some of the poblano. Cover with the bun tops and serve immediately.
