                        salt and pepper
  1              pound  penne
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2             cloves  garlic -- thinly sliced
     2/3         pound  cherry tomato (2 cups) -- halved or quartered
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
     1/4           cup  kalamata olive -- pitted and sliced
     1/4           cup  parsley -- chopped
     1/4           cup  grated parmesan cheese

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the penne al dente. Drain.

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until just golden, about 1 minute. Add the cherry tomatoes, oregano, crushed red pepper, 1/2 tspn salt, and 1/4 tspn pepper. Reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring, until tomato juices run, about 3 minutes.

Add the penne, olives, parsley, and 1/4 cup cheese to the skillet and toss to combine. Serve with more cheese.
