--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  fresh orange juice -- divided
  1 1/4           cups  fresh lime juice -- divided
  1                     orange -- zested
  1                     lime -- zested
     1/2           cup  fresh oregano -- finely chopped
  12            cloves  garlic -- coarsely chopped
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  1                     bone-in pork shoulder (4-6 lbs) -- trimmed of excess fat
                        salt and pepper
                        mojo dipping sauce
  8             cloves  garlic
  1                     serrano pepper -- chopped
  3        tablespoons  cilantro -- chopped
                        salt
     1/2           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  lime juice
     1/4           cup  extra virgin olive oil

Combine 4 cups of the orange juice and 1 cup of the lime juice and the zests in a large saucpan over high heat and reduce to 2 cups. Remove from heat and stir in remaining orange and lime juice and a few cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup of the oregano. Let cool to room temperature.

Using a paring knife, make small slits over the surface of the pork and run the garlic into the slashes. Whisk together the oil and remaining 1/4 cup of the oregano in a large roasting pan, add the pork and turn to coat, cover and let marinate in the refrigerator at least 4 hours.

Preheat oven to 425.

Remove pork from the fridge 30 minutes before roasting. Season the pork with salt and pepper and cook for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 and continue roasting, basting with the marinade during the last 30 minutes until golden brown and a thermometer reads 150. Remove from oven, baste with rest of glaze, tent loosely and let rest for 15 minutes.

Using a mortar and pestle, mash garlic, serrano, cilantro and a few pinches of salt until it becomes a paste. Add orange juice, lime juice and oil and stir to combine.
