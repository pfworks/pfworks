  2             slices  white bread
  2        tablespoons  whole milk
  1              pound  ground beef
     1/2           cup  pecorino romano -- freshly grated
  2        tablespoons  plain fine dry bread crumbs
  2              large  eggs
  2             ounces  pancetta -- thinly sliced
                        salt
                        freshly ground black pepper
                        butter
     3/4           cup  drained canned whole peeled tomatoes -- coarsely chopped
  4             ounces  fresh mozzarella
  2        tablespoons  shredded fresh basil leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  dried whole oregano

Preheat oven to 425

Cut crusts from bread. Put the bread and milk in a small bowl and mash with hands to get a smooth paste. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and add the beef, pecorino, bread crumbs and eggs.

Chop the pancetta and add it to the bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Mix everything together thoroughly with hands.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 10 in pie dish. Put in the ground beef mixture and spread it out evenly. Cover with the tomatoes. Cut the mozzarella into strips and arrange them over the tomatoes. Sprinkle the basil and oregano on top.

Bake in oven for 20 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes and remove with 2 spatulas to a serving plate.
