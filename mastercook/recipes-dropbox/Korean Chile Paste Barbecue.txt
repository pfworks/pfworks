--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        marinade
  4                     scallion -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  toasted sesame seeds
  2             cloves  garlic -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  fresh ginger -- chopped
     1/3           cup  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  sesame oil
  1         tablespoon  rice vinegar
  2          teaspoons  sugar
                        the rest
  1 1/4         pounds  sirloin steak -- thinly sliced across the grain
  1 1/2           cups  short grain rice
  3               cups  water
  1               head  red leaf lettuce -- leaves separated
     1/4           cup  kochujang (or chinese chile paste with garlic)

In a large, nonreactive bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients. Add the steak and toss to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator.

In a pot, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer until the water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.

Heat a heavy skillet, preferably cast-iron, until hot. Remove meat from marinade and quickly cook, a few pieces at a time, turning to evenly brown, about 1 minute per batch.

To serve, line the edge of a serving platter with the lettuce leaves, mound the rice in the center, and place the beef around the rice. Serve the kochujang on the side.

To eat, add a scoop of rice and a few pieces of beef to a lettuce leaf, and top with sauce. Roll up and enjoy.
