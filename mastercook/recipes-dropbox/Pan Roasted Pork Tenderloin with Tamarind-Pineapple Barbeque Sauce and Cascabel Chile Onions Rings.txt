                        BBQ Sauce
  8               cups  chicken stock
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1                     spanish onion -- coarsely chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- coarsely chopped
  1         tablespoon  ancho chile powder
  1         tablespoon  pasilla chile powder
  2        tablespoons  tamarind paste

                        salt and pepper
                        Pork Tenderloin

  1           teaspoon  ancho chile powder
                        salt and pepper
                        Onion Rings
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  buttermilk
                        cayenne
                        salt
  3              large  spanish onion -- 3/4" rings
  4               cups  peanut oil
  2               cups  seasoned flour -- salt and pepper

Place chicken stock in a medium saucepan over high heat and reduce to 4 cups. Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook until soft. Add the chile powders and cook for 2 minutes. Add the reduced stock and bring to a simmer, whisk in the tamarind paste and brown sugar. Add the pineapple and cook over med-low heat until the pineapple is very soft, 30-40 minutes. Place the mixture, in batches, in a blender and strain into a clean saucepan. Cook for 15-20 minutes until reduced slightly. Season with salt and pepper.

Preheat oven to 400. Heat olive oil in a medium saute pan over high heat. Season the pork with the ancho powder, salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Sear well on all sides until golden brown. Place pan in the oven and continue cooking for 8-10 minutes until the pork is just cooked through. Remove and let rest 10 minutes before slicing on the bias. Spoon sauce onto platter, top with pork slices, drizzle with sauce.

In  mixing bowl, combine the flour, buttermilk, cayenne and salt to make a batter. Soak the rings in the batter for 2 hours or longer in the refrigerator. When ready to fry, heat the oil to 375, or until a drop of batter sizzles. Dredge rings in seasoned flour and fry, turning, in batches, until tender and golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and season with salt.
