--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  chile powder
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1         tablespoon  onion powder
  1         tablespoon  ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  2          teaspoons  dry mustard
  1                     bay leaf -- crushed
  4             pounds  beef brisket -- trimmed
  1 1/2           cups  beef stock

Preheat oven to 350.

Make a dry rub combining chile powder, salt, garlic and onion powders, black pepper, sugar, dry mustard and bay leaf. Season the raw brisket on both sides with the rub. Place in a roasting pan and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour.

Add beef stock and enough water to yield about 1/2 inch of liquid in the roasting pan. Lower oven to 300 degrees, cover pan tightly and continue cooking for 3 hours, or until fork-tender.

Trim the fat and slice meat thinly across the grain. Top with juice from pan.
