  5              large  red bell pepper
                        canola oil
     1/2         pound  capicola -- 1/4" dice
  3 1/2         pounds  pork country-style ribs
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1         tablespoon  black pepper
  3               cups  onion -- 1" pieces
     1/2           cup  garlic -- roughly chopped
  1 1/2    tablespoons  capers
  2        tablespoons  caper juice
     1/2           cup  white wine
     1/2           cup  agave syrup
  1                cup  chicken stock
  1                cup  red wine vinegar

Preheat oven to 300. Rub peppers with canola oil, put them on a baking sheet and roast in oven until golden brown, 45 minutes to one hour. Remove to a bowl and cover. Remove skin and seeds and dice. Do not rinse.

Put Dutch oven on stove top over high heat, coat with canola oil and add capicola. Saute for 3-5 minutes. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and add them to pot with 3 tablespoons of oil. Brown well on all side, then remove to a plate. Add the onions and saute until beginning to carmelize, then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stie in the capers and caper juice. Mix to combine and allow to carmelize more. Deglaze with white wine. Stir in the agave, chicken stock, and red wine vinegar. Bring to a boil, then add the seared ribs along with diced peppers. 

Cover and bake for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove the pork to a serving platter and serve with sauce. Reduce sauce for 5-10 minutes if desired.
