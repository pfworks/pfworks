  1               head  cauliflower -- about 2 lbs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt

Chop off the stem of the cauliflower and break up the remainder into florets. Put the cauliflower in a steam basket over water in a pot with a lid. Make sure you have water up to the basket. Bring to a boil, and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until tender. Drain and coarsely mash the florets with a potato masher before putting into a food processor. Add the butter and salt and blend until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Scrape and serve.
