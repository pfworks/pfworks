--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground pork
  1                     red onion -- finely chopped
  16                    saltine cracker -- crumbled
     1/2           cup  whole milk
  2                     egg -- lightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
                        vegetable oil
                        dijon mustard

Using your hands, combine pork, saltines, onion, eggs, milk, salt and pepper in a large bowl.

Lightly brush a large, nonstick frying pan with oili. Heat the pan on medium high. Divide the pork mixture into 8 equal portions. Working in batches, drop each portion into the hot pan, spacing them to not crowd the pan. Path them down with the back of a spoon to form them into patties. Cook the patties, turning once, for 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown.

Serve with mustard.
