  12                    ancho chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  7                     pasilla chiles -- stemmed and seeded
  2 1/2    tablespoons  cumin seeds -- toasted and ground
  1         tablespoon  whole coriander seeds -- toasted and ground
  1 1/2    tablespoons  mexican oregano
  2          teaspoons  unsweetened chocolate
  1           teaspoon  cayenne
  1 1/2    tablespoons  sweet hungarian paprika
  6             pounds  beef chuck roast
     1/3           cup  lard or shortening
  2              large  onion -- chopped
  15            cloves  garlic -- minced
     2/3           cup  tomato paste
  15            ounces  tomato sauce
  3             quarts  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  masa harina -- whisked into 2/3 cup stock from above
                        kosher salt

Heat a heavy bottomed 12-14 inch skillet over med-high heat. When hot, add layer of chiles. Cook, turning often, until strong aroma appears. Spread on wire rack to cool. Do not burn. Repeat with all chiles.

Grind chiles to a fine powder, removing large pieces. Combine with cumin, coriander, oregano, cocoa, paprika, cayenne and black pepper. Set aside.

Trim roast. Chop into 1/2" dice. Melt the lard in an 8 qt dutch oven over medium heat. Add meat and sear, stirring. Add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are wilted and transparent, about 7 minutes. Add tomato paste and stir to blend. Cook, stirring, until paste is thick and dark in color, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and chili-spice mixture. Stir, then add chicken stock. Bring to a boil and lower heat to a simmer and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1.5 hours. Stir in masa mixture and alt to taste. Cook, uncovered, for an additional 30-45 minutes on low-medium heat, or until the chili is thickened and the meat is fork-tender. Stir often. Taste and adjust seasonings.
