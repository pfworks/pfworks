--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  bittersweet chocolate -- chopped into small pieces
  1              stick  unsalted butter
  9              large  eggs -- separated
     3/4           cup  granulated sugar
  1         tablespoon  granulated sugar
  2               cups  heavy cream
                        powdered sugar

Preheat oven to 350. Butter a 9 inch springform pan.

Put the chocolate and butter into the top of a double boiler and heat over about 1 inch of simmering water until melted. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a mixing bowl until light yellow in color. Whisk a little of the chocolat mixture into the egg mixture to temper the eggs, then whisk in the rest of the chocolate mixture.

Beat the egg whites in a mixing bowl until stiff peaks form and fold into the chocolate mixture. Pour into the prepared pan (spray bottom with nonstick spray) and bake until the cake is set, the top starts to crack, and a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out with moist crumbs clingning to it, 20 to 25 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes then unmold.

While the cake is cooking, make the whipped cream. Whip the cream unti it becomes light and fluffy. Dust cake with powdered sugar.

Serve at room temp with whipped cream.
