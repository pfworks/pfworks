  8               cups  chicken broth
     1/3           cup  tomato paste
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt

Stem the jalepenos. Grind the jalapenos, black pepper, coriander, turmeric, cumin, nutmeg, cloves, garlic, and ginger to a paste.

Heat butter in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add the spice paste and meat, and cook for 5 minutes.

Add the broth, tomato paste, and salt; bring to a simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes. Add the carrot, apple, and potato. Simmer until everything is tender, another 20 minutes.

Add the peas and simmer until just heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve the soup in heated bowls, garnished with lemon slices.
