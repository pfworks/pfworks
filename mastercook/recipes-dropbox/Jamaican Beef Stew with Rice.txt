                        kosher salt and pepper
  1             medium  white onion -- finely chopped
  4                     carrots -- peeled and cut into chunks
  2                     habanero chile -- seeded and minced
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/4           cup  rum
  2               cups  chicken stock
     1/2      teaspoon  allspice
     1/4      teaspoon  cinnamon
  1           teaspoon  hot pepper sauce
  4             sprigs  fresh thyme
  2                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
  14 1/2        ounces  fire roasted diced tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
  1 1/2    tablespoons  steak sauce
     1/2           cup  scallion -- chopped
  2               cups  cooked long grain white rice

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300. Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over high heat until smoking. Season beef with salt and pepper. Add beef to pan and cook without moving until well browned on one side, about 6 minutes. Stir to loosen meat, and add onions and carrots. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes, reduce heat to medium and add habeneros, garlic and rum. Bring to a  boil and simmer for 2 minutes before adding broth, allspice, cinnamon, hot pepper sauce, thyme, bay leaves, brown sugar, red wine vinegar, tomatoes, soy sauce, and steak sauce.

Return to a boil, cover and transfer to oven. Continue cooking until meat is tear-apart tender, about 1.5 hours more.

When done, remove from oven and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Reduce over stovetop if not thick enough. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with green onions and serve with rice.
