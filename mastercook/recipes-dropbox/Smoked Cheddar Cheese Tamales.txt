--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  40                    dried corn husks
  4               cups  masa harina
     1/4      teaspoon  baking soda
  2          teaspoons  sea salt
  4               cups  chicken broth -- warmed
  1                cup  lard or shortening -- melted
  6                     poblano chiles
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1                cup  white onion -- chopped
  1                cup  scallion -- chopped
     1/2           cup  tomatoes -- diced
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar
                        kosher salt and pepper
  1              pound  smoked cheddar cheese -- grated
     1/2         pound  white vermont cheddar cheese -- grated
  1                cup  sour cream
  1         tablespoon  lime zest -- grated

Put the corn husks in a roasting pan of warm water; soak until softened, about 30 minutes.

Whisk the masa harina, baking soda, and sea salt in a large bowl. Stir in the chicken broth and lard with a wooden spoon to make a thick dough. Let the dough rest 30 minutes.

Prehest broiler. Put the poblanos on a foil-line broiler pan, then roast, cool and peel. Stem, seed and dice.

Heat the butter and vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and scallions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the poblanos, tomatoes and vinegar, season with kosher salt and pepper, and cook 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely. Fold in both cheeses.

Remove the corn husks from the water and gently squeeze dry. Tear 4 husks into think strips to use as ties. Spread a heaping tablespoonful of dough onto the wide end of each remaining husk, leaving a 1/2" border on the top and both sides and 3 inches on the tapered end. Spread 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture over the dough, then roll up into cigar shape. Fold the tapered end and tie closed with a strip of husk.

Put the tamales upright in a steamer basket set over a few inches of boiling water; steam until the filling is firm, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove and let rest 10 minutes.

Mix the sour cream and lime zest in a small bowl and season with kosher salt. Unwrap tamales and serve with the lime sour cream.
