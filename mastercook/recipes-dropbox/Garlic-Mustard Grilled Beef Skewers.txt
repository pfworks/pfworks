--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        glaze
     1/4           cup  whole grain mustard
  2        tablespoons  dijon mustard
  4             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  low-sodium soy sauce
  1         tablespoon  honey
  1         tablespoon  rosemary leaves -- finely chopped
  2          teaspoons  spanish paprika
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
                        skewers
  2             pounds  beef tenderloin
  12                    6 inch wooden skewers

Whisk together all glaze ingredients in a small bowl. Let sit at room temp for 30 minutes to 4 hours.

Cut tenderloin lengthwise in half, then cut the halves lengthwise in half again. Slice crosswise to make 24 pieces. Skewer 2 pieces of beef onto each skewer, keeping them together at one end of skewer. Place skewers in a baking dish or sheet and pour half the glaze over them, turning to coat.

Grill the meat, turning once and brushing with remaining glaze, for 4-6 minutes until golden brown, slightly charred, and cooked to medium rare. Transfer to cutting board and let rest 5 minutes.

Serve.
