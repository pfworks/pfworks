                        hardwood lump charcoal (not briquettes)
  4                     1.25" thick porterhouse steaks (about 16 oz)
                        coarse sea salt
                        coarsely cracked whole black peppercorns
     1/3           cup  extra virgin olive oil
  2                     poblano chiles -- seeded and cut into 2 x 1/4 in strips
  2                     red bell pepper -- cut into strips
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cut into strips
  1                cup  cilantro -- coarsely chopped
  2              large  shallot -- thinly sliced

Prepare BBQ using hardwood lump charcoal. When charcoal is orange, spread out in even layer on lower grill rack. Use newspaper to fan excess ash from coals. Sprinkle steaks generously with sea salt and peppercorns. Arrange steaks in single layer directly atop hot embers and grill until desired doneness, 4-5 minutes per side for med-rare. Using long tongs, transfer steaks to plate. Using natural bristle brush, remove any embers and loose ash from steaks. Tent steaks with foil and let rest 10 minutes.

Add oil to 12 inch diameter cast iron skiller. Place skillet directly atop embers in grill. When oil begins to smoke, add chiles and all remaining ingredients to skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; saute until vegetables begin to brown, 2-5 minutes. Remove skillet from BBQ. Season pan-fry with salt and pepper. Pour over steaks and serve.
