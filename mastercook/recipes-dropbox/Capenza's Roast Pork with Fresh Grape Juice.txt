--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  16                    sage leaves
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary (4 inches) -- leaves removed and stems discarded
  2          teaspoons  kosher salt
  1           teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper
  1                     bone-in loin pork roast (6 bones - about 4 pounds) -- chine removed
  1              pound  seedless red grapes (enough for 2 cups grape juice)
  1                cup  onions -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  celery -- finely chopped
     1/2           cup  carrot -- finely chopped
  6             cloves  garlic
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  cornstarch -- mixed with 2 tbs water
                        fresh grape and sage leaves for garnish

Finely chop the sage and rosemary leaves and combine with salt and pepper in small bowl.

Cut some slashes in the fat side of pork and rub the herb mixture into the slashes and all over the surface of the meat.

Puree the grapes in a blender. Set juice aside.

Preheat oven to 450.

Scatter the onions, celery, carrot and garlic in a roasting pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with the oil. Place the roast, fat-side up, on the vegetables. Put in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 325. Pour 1 cup of the grape juice over the roast and roast, adding water if the juice evaporates completely. After 45 minutes, begin checking the internal temperature and remove roast when it reaches 140-145, which may take 1-1.25 hours. Transfer the roast to a platter and cover loosely with foil for 15 minutes.

Put the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 cup of grape juice. Bring to a boil, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan. Transfer the contents of the roasting pan to a small saucepan, let stand for a few minutes, and remove the fat from surface. Reduce the pan juices over high heat until slightly syrupy. If you'd like a fresher grape taste, redude the sauce less and thicken with cornstarch mixture.

To serve, separate bones from the meat and cut int individual rib bones. Slice the meat into 1/2 inch slices and pour the sauce over them. Garnish with leaves and bones.
