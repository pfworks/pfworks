                        kosher salt
  8             ounces  fusilli
  3             strips  bacon
  3             cloves  garlic -- thinly sliced
  28            ounces  whole peeled tomatoes -- crushed by hand with juice
     1/4      teaspoon  crushed red pepper
  5             leaves  basil
     1/2          head  escarole, torn into bie size pieces (about 4 cups)
     1/2           cup  part-skim ricotta cheese
     1/4           cup  parmesan cheese
  8             ounces  part skim milk mozzarella cheese -- 1/2" cubes

Preheat oven to 400. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta. Drain and reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water.

Meanwhile, lay bacon in a large ovenproff skillet and cook over medium heat until brown and slightly crispy, 4-5 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat, transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate and pour off all but 1 tbspn of the drippings. Break into bite size pieces.

Return skillet to medium heat, add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and juices, reserved pasta water, crushed red pepper, basil, escarole and 1/2 tspn salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens and the escrole wilts, 15-20 minutes.

Mix together ricotta and parmesan. Add the cooked pasta and mozzarella to the sauce and stir thouroughly to coat. Drop spoonfuls of the cheese mixture on top. Sprinkle with bacon pieces and bake until bubbly and cheese melts, 15-20 minutes. Let rest. Garnish with basil.
