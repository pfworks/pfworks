  4                     rib steaks
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
                        olive oil
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil for frying
                        Pinot Noir Reduction
  2                     shallot -- minced
  3        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2               cups  Pinot Noir
  2              dozen  fresh bing cherries -- pitted
     1/2           cup  chicken stock
                        Cauliflower Mash
                        Glazed Carrots

Prepare steaks by salting them, then let them come to room temperature. Rub them with oil before cooking.

To make the sauce, quickly saute the shallots in 2 tablespoons of the butter to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the wine, cherries, and chicken juices before the butter browns. Cook the sauce about 20 minutes, to reduce to about 1/2 cup, stirring frequently. When it's done, it should be the consistency of heated jam. Set aside.

When the steaks are done cooking, reheat the sauce and add 1 tablespoon butter.

Serve with cauliflower mash and carrots, and then spoon sauce over top.

  1               head  cauliflower -- about 2 lbs
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Chop off the stem of the cauliflower and break up the remainder into florets. Put the cauliflower in a steam basket over water in a pot with a lid. Make sure you have water up to the basket. Bring to a boil, and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until tender. Drain and coarsely mash the florets with a potato masher before putting into a food processor. Add the butter and salt and blend until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Scrape and serve.
