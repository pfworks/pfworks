--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  head of cauliflower
  1           teaspoon  kosher salt
  6        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  2        tablespoons  whole grain Dijon mustard
  1 1/2      teaspoons  lemon peel -- finely grated

Preheat oven to 400. Butter rimmed baking sheet. Cut cauliflower in half, then cut crosswise into 1/4" thick slices. Arrange slices in single layer on prepared sheet; sprinkle with salt. Roast until cauliflower is slightly softened, about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in lemon juice, mustard and lemon peel.

Spoon sauce evenly over cauliflower and roast until crisp-tender, about 10 minutes longer.

Transfer to platter and sprinkle with parsley.
