--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     red bell peppers -- halved lenghtwise
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1              bunch  scallion (including greens) -- thinly sliced
  3               cups  corn kernels (from 5 ears of corn)
  2                     tomato -- peeled, seeded and diced
  1                cup  grated cheddar cheese
  2        tablespoons  basil leaves -- finely sliced
     2/3           cup  fresh bread crumbs
                        salt and pepper
                        paprika

Preheat oven to 375. Lightly butte a baking dish just large enough to hold the peppers.

If the red peppers won't stand upright, slice them lengthwise in half, leaving the stem end intact. Steam them for 5 minutes and set aside.

Melt the butter in a large skillet. Add the scallions, corn and tomatoes and cook for 3 minutes over medium heat. Turn off the heat and stir in the cheese, basil, and half the bread crumbs. Season with salt and pepper. Fill the peppers and top with the remaining bread crumbs. Set them in a prepared dish, add a few tablespoons water to the dish, cover, and bake until the corn is hot and the peppers are cooked, about 25 minutes. Uncover and brown the tops under a broiler. Dust with paprika and serve.
