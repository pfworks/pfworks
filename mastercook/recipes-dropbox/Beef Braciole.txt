--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  boneless beef round -- cut into 4 thin slices, about 1/3"
  4             slices  prosciutto
  1         tablespoon  pine nut
  2        tablespoons  pecorino romano cheese -- grated
  2             cloves  garlic -- chopped
  2        tablespoons  parsley -- chopped
     1/2           cup  olive oil
  2               cans  imported italian tomatoes (28 oz each)
     1/4           cup  tomato puree
  2                     bay leaf
  3                     basil leaf -- torn into small pieces
  1             medium  yellow onion -- chopped fine
  2                     celery stalk -- chopped fine
  2                     carrot -- peeled and chopped fine
  1                cup  dry red wine
                        flour
                        salt and pepper

Place each slice of beef between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat pounder until 1/4" thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Lay a slice of prosciutto on each one and sprinkle evenly with the pine nuts, cheese, garlic and parsley. Roll up the slices, tucking in the ends and tie with kitchen string.

Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Dredge the steaks in flour, shaking off any excess and then place in the pan. Cook until browned on all sides, about 15 minutes.

Heat the other 1/4 cup of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add steaks, bay leaves, salt and pepper.

Add red wine and cook until most of liquid evaporates, about 2 minutes. Pass the tomatoes, with their juices through a food mill or sieve into the saucepan. Fill one of the tomato cans 1/2 way with water and add to saucepan. Add puree, turn heat to low and cook at a simmer until beef is tender, 1.5 - 2 hours.

Sprinkle the basil over the rolls, and cook for 2 more minutes. Transfer to plates, spoon sauce over top and serve.
