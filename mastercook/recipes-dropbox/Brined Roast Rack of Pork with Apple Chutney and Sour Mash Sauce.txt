  1                     spanish onion -- peeled and quartered

     1/4        medium  spanish onion -- finely chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- finely chopped
  2        tablespoons  fresh ginger -- finely chopped
  1                cup  fresh orange juice
  3        tablespoons  light brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  honey
  5              large  granny Smith apple -- peeled, cored and thickly sliced
  1           teaspoon  allspice -- ground
     1/4      teaspoon  kosher salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly ground black pepper

Bring the water, concentrate, salt, sugar, onion, peppercorns, mustard, thyme and bay leaves to a simmer in a large stock pot and cook until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Let cool completely. Submerge the roast in the brine by placing a plate on top, the cover with plastic and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.

Preheat oven to 425.

Remove the pork from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Season the pork all over with salt and pepper and cook on both sides until golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer pork to a baking sheet and finish cooking in the oven until cooked to an internal temperature of 150F, about 25-30 minutes. Remove and let rest, tented, for 10 minutes.

While the pork is roasting, add the whiskey to the saute pan that the pork was cooked in, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, and cook until almost completely reduced. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced to a sauce like consistency. Whisk in the butter, season with salt and pepper, and stir in the parsley.

Cut pork into chops, top each with Apple-Ginger chutney, and drizzle a little of the sauce around the pork and over the chutney. Garnish with parsley sprig.

To make chutney: Heat oil in a medium saucepan over med-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute. Increase the heat to high, then add the orange juice, brown sugar, and honey and bring to a simmer. Stir in the apples, allspice, and salt and pepper, cover, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the apples are soft and the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes.
