--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  butter
  1                cup  shallot -- chopped
  3                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              large  red bell pepper -- coarsely chopped
  3               cups  fresh corn kernels (5 medium ears)
     2/3           cup  whipping cream -- divided
     1/4           cup  bourbon
  1 1/4           cups  green onions (6) -- chopped

Melt butter in heavy large skillet over med-high heat. Add shallots and garlic; saute 2 minutes. Add red bell pepper; saute 1 minute. Add corn; saute until almost tender, about 2 minutes. Add 1/3 cup cream and bourbon. Simmer until sauce thickly coats corn, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/3 cup cream and 1 cup green onions. Simmer until sauce thickens enough to coat corn thinly, about 2 minutes longer. Season creamed corn to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to bowl; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup green onions and serve.
