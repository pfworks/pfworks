--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped white onions
  2                     poblano chiles -- roasted, peeled, stemmed, seeded and coarsely chopped
  2          teaspoons  chopped garlic
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4           cup  roughly chopped cilantro leaves
     1/4           cup  roughly chopped parsley leaves
  1 3/4           cups  chicken stock
  1                cup  long grain white rice

In a medium saucepan, heat 1.5 tspns of the oil over med-high heat. Add the onions and chiles and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, salt, cilantro, parsley, and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and transfer to a blender with 1/2 cup of the stock. Process on high until smooth.

Heat the remaining tbspn of oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the puree and cook, stirring, to evaporate most of the liquid, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining stock, stir and cover, and lower the heat to med-low. Simmer without stirring, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit without stirring for 10 to 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and server, garnished with additional cilantro.
