  3             pounds  skirt steak
  1                     white onion -- quartered
  3             cloves  garlic
  2                     turkish bay leaves or 1 california
     1/4      teaspoon  black peppercorns
  3              whole  allspice
  1              whole  clove
                        sauces
     3/4         pound  tomatoes -- quartered
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  3             ounces  dried guajillo chiles (12-15)
     1/4      teaspoon  black peppercorn
     1/4      teaspoon  cumin seed
  3              whole  allspice
  1              whole  clove
     1/2           cup  white onion -- chopped
  3              large  garlic clove
  5                     chile de arbol -- stemmed and seeded
  3               cups  beef or chicken broth

Put all beef ingredients in a 5 to 6 qt heavy pot with 1 tsp salt and enough water (about 2 qt) to cover. Simmer, partially covered, skimming foam and adding more hot water if necesary to keep beef covered until tender, about 2 hours. Remove beef, cool, and shred. Strain broth through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl, discarding solids. Skim off fat.

Toss tomatoes with 1 tbsp of oil in a 4 sided sheet pan. Broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until soften and charred, 10 to 12 minutes. Slit guajillo chiles lengthwise, then stem and seed. Heat a dry heavy medium skillet over med heat until hot, then toast chiles in 2 batches, opened flat, turning and pressing with tongs, until pliable and changed in color, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to bowl and soak in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

Toast peppercorns, cumin seeds, allspice and clove in a hot skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a blender.

Drain soaked chiles and puree in blender with toasted spices, broiled tomatoes, onion, garlic, chiles de arbol, 2 cups broth, and 1 tsp salt until smooth.

Heat remaining 2 tbsp oil in a cleaned pot over med-high heat until it shimmers, then slowly add sauce and simmer, stirring frequently, 5 minutes. Add beef and 1 cup broth and cook over med-low heat, stirring, until meat is heated through, about 5 minutes.
