--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     boneless pork rib chops -- trimmed
  3        tablespoons  grainy mustard
                        salt and pepper
  2        tablespoons  peanut oil
  1             medium  onion -- finely sliced
  2               cups  apple cider
  1 1/2           cups  self-rising flour
  2        tablespoons  vegetable shortening -- chilled
     3/4           cup  milk

Coat one side of each pork chop with mustard and season both sides with salt and pepper. In a large, heavy skillet, heat the oil over moderate heat, add chops uncoated side down, and brown for 5 minutes. Add onion and stir for about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of the cider, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook over low heat till the chops are almost tender, 45-50 minutes. Add remaining cider and return to a simmer.



In a bowl, combine flour and shortening and cut with a pastry cutter till mealy. Add milk and stir till well blended and sticky. Drop dough by tablespoons onto the chops (not the liquid) and cook, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Cover the skillet, cook for                             10 minutes longer, and transfer chops and dumplings to a platter. Increase heat, cook down liquid until thickened, and spoon over chops and dumplings.
